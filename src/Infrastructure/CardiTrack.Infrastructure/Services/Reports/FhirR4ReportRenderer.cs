/// This is the format with an external judge — a portal either accepts the bundle or it does not —
/// so the mapping sticks to codes those systems already recognise: LOINC for every observation,
/// UCUM for every unit, and US Core-shaped <c>Patient</c> and <c>Observation</c> resources. A
/// reading with no agreed LOINC code is left out rather than given an invented one; a bundle that
/// imports cleanly and says less is worth more than one that says everything and is rejected.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>No free text crosses into a FHIR export</strong> — no medical notes, no alert message
/// bodies, no caregiver device labels (docs/technical/data_protection_architecture.md §70, §85).
/// What does carry through is the member's real identity: unlike the AI narrative path, this
/// document is going to the subject's own care team, and a <c>Patient</c> resource without a name
/// is useless to the receiving system.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Alerts are not in the bundle</strong>, in MVP 1. They are CardiTrack's own statistical
/// findings, and the honest FHIR shapes for them (<c>DetectedIssue</c>, <c>Flag</c>, or an
/// <c>Observation</c> carrying the triggering reading) each imply a different clinical meaning to
/// the receiving system — a choice with an external judge, which is the same reason a reading with
/// no agreed LOINC code is omitted rather than given an invented one. <c>GenerateReportValidator</c>
/// therefore refuses a FHIR request that would carry nothing but alerts, so the gap is a 400 the
/// caregiver can act on rather than a bundle that arrives quietly missing what they asked for.
