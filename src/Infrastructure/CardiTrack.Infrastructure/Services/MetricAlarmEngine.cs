/// <summary>
/// The user-defined alarm engine. Every five minutes it resolves each member's effective alarms —
/// account-level defaults plus their own overrides — cuts their readings into datapoints, and asks
/// <see cref="MetricAlarmEvaluator"/> for a verdict.
/// <para>
/// <b>An alert is written on the transition into alarm, never on the state.</b> The stored
/// <see cref="MetricAlarmState"/> is what makes that distinction possible, and it is also why this
/// producer needs no cooldown of its own: a condition that stays true keeps the alarm standing and
/// stays quiet, and only a return to normal re-arms it. That is deliberately not the alert
/// lifecycle — a caregiver acknowledging a card is saying they have read it, not that the heart
/// rate has come down.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Two reads per member, not two per alarm.</b> Every sub-daily alarm the member has is served
/// from one minute-series fetch sized to the longest of them, and every daily alarm from one
/// activity-log fetch. A member with eight alarms costs the same queries as a member with one.
