### API Specification (canonical)

Located in [`/execution/backend/api/`](./execution/backend/api/readme.md) — the **source of truth for all REST endpoints** (`/api/v1/*`), organized by domain (auth, cardimembers, devices, health-data, alerts, family, notifications, questionnaires, subscriptions, reports). The app-level READMEs below link here and do not duplicate endpoint documentation.

### UI Specifications

Located in `/execution/ui/`:
- [Mobile screen specs](./execution/ui/mobile/ui_screens_maui_mobile.md) and [mobile user stories](./execution/ui/mobile/user_stories.md) (.NET MAUI) — MVP 1 extracts live in [`/execution/ui/mobile/mvp1/`](./execution/ui/mobile/mvp1/screens.md)
- [Web screen specs](./execution/ui/web/ui_screens_blazor_web.md) and [web user stories](./execution/ui/web/user_stories.md) (Blazor Server)

---

### Application Documentation

Located in `/apps/` — each application has its own README covering stack, structure, configuration, and local development.

#### [apps/api/](./apps/api/readme.md)
**ASP.NET Core Web API** — stack, project structure, middleware, configuration, running locally. Endpoint documentation lives in [`/execution/backend/api/`](./execution/backend/api/readme.md).

#### [apps/web/](./apps/web/readme.md)
**Blazor Web App** — current state (template shell, health-data disclosure banner, privacy page, APM/DataProtection wiring), planned dashboard features, running locally, deployment.

#### [apps/mobile/](./apps/mobile/readme.md)
**.NET MAUI Mobile App** — cross-platform architecture (iOS, Android), code-behind pages + Mobile.Core (Auth0 native login, API client), onboarding flow, APM/crash reporting, store publishing; planned platform work (push actions, offline); no HealthKit or Health Connect — Apple and Samsung watch data arrives server-side via Google Health.

#### [apps/mobile/store_provisioning.md](./apps/mobile/store_provisioning.md)
**Store provisioning** — one-time keys, certificates, and Secret Manager secrets that let CI deliver signed builds to TestFlight and the Google Play internal testing track.

#### [apps/worker/](./apps/worker/readme.md)
**CardiTrack.Worker Background Service** — the .NET Worker Service hosting the **13 non-AI background jobs** (10-minute wearable data sync with in-path OAuth token refresh, daily orphaned-organization cleanup, daily baseline calculation, partition retention — granular 90 d / rollups 13 mo / **digests and journal entries 7 months** / assessments 90 d / environmental 90 d — inactivity + statistical alerting, device-auth recovery, data-completeness checks, notification dispatch, and a push canary) using cron scheduling via Cronos. The AI ingestion/inference pipeline is live in dev on GCP (Pub/Sub + Cloud Run) — see [llm_design.md](./llm_design.md).

---

### Technical Reference

Located in `/technical/` — detailed technical guides and specifications.

#### [auth0_integration.md](./technical/auth0_integration.md)
Complete guide to Auth0 authentication integration, OAuth flows, and security configuration.

#### [auth0_setup_runbook.md](./technical/auth0_setup_runbook.md)
Operator runbook for configuring the Auth0 tenant per environment (dev, prod) to match the implemented mobile auth and the API's JWT validation.

#### [apm_setup_runbook.md](./technical/apm_setup_runbook.md)
**Observability/APM** — Serilog + OpenTelemetry with a switchable APM engine (`Apm:Engine`; Datadog deployed, console-only when unset locally); token provisioning and setup steps.

#### [claude_cloud_environment_setup.md](./technical/claude_cloud_environment_setup.md)
**Claude Code cloud environment config** — name, network access/domain allowlist, environment variables, and setup script for the "New cloud environment" dialog, so a fresh cloud session builds, runs, and tests `CardiTrack.Server.slnf` with no manual follow-up.

#### [oauth_clients.md](./technical/oauth_clients.md)
Inventory of every OAuth client (identity vs device-data), social log-on scope, and provisioning steps for the Auth0 and Google Health API clients.

#### [entity_summary.md](./technical/entity_summary.md)
Detailed summary of all domain entities, their properties, and relationships.

#### [data_sync_architecture.md](./technical/data_sync_architecture.md)
**Data sync & data pull allocation view** — which component runs on which node, over which technology, at which cadence: the 10-minute Worker poll, per-connection due-ness, the trailing window, manual sync, the weekly audit pull, and the R2 webhook pipeline.

#### [notification_engine.md](./technical/notification_engine.md)
**Notification engine** — reliable alert delivery: the in-app data-completeness engine plus the full push spine (notification outbox, `NotificationDispatchWorker`, FCM HTTP v1 with APNs passthrough, 120s/300s/900s escalation ladder, quiet hours, mobile registration and receipt handling, push canary).

#### [production_setup_runbook.md](./technical/production_setup_runbook.md)
**Production setup runbook** — the manual ops ledger: every console grant, API registration, and credential-provisioning step performed outside Terraform/CI, in the order production needs them, with dev status as evidence.

#### [github_repository_access.md](./technical/github_repository_access.md)
**GitHub repository access** — stays public so Actions minutes are free (private Free-plan quota is exhausted); write is limited to one human (`@marigbede`). Apps-dev/infra on push and PR are gated by `.github/ACTIONS_ON_PUSH` (`0`/`1`).

#### [data_protection_architecture.md](./technical/data_protection_architecture.md)
HIPAA/GDPR data architecture (ADR): identifier/clinical schema separation, Safe Harbor de-identification pipeline, retention & erasure jobs, audit/consent models, and the subprocessor register.

#### [granular_timeseries_storage.md](./technical/granular_timeseries_storage.md)
**Granular time-series storage (ADR)** — sub-daily wearable samples stay in the existing Cloud SQL instance as day-partitioned hour-vector tables (no Bigtable/BigQuery); rollup ladder, retention, alternatives, and the triggers that would reopen the decision.

#### [mathnet_numerics.md](./technical/mathnet_numerics.md)
**Math.NET Numerics (ADR)** — in-process statistical engine for SSA eigen-decomposition; median/MAD persisted on baselines but unused for live alerts; Art. 13–15 / Art. 22 documentation gaps.

#### [alarm_catalogue.md](./technical/alarm_catalogue.md)
**Caregiver-defined alarms — suggested defaults and their sources.** What CardiTrack can and cannot alarm on (no blood pressure, weight or rhythm flag is ingested), the published guidance behind each suggested threshold with organisation and URL, why the controls rather than the numbers are the design, the FDA framing that governs how a threshold may be presented, and an explicit list of where sources disagree or a figure is ours. Carries a verification-status caveat: the numbers are cross-corroborated, the wording is not.

#### [enum_extensions_guide.md](./technical/enum_extensions_guide.md)
Guide to enum extensions and helper methods used throughout the solution.

#### [user_onboarding_process.md](./technical/user_onboarding_process.md)
Step-by-step guide to the user onboarding process, device connection flows, and OAuth integration.

---

### Compliance

Located in `/compliance/`.

#### [dpia.md](./compliance/dpia.md)
Data Protection Impact Assessment (GDPR Art. 35) — processing inventory, risk assessment, and mitigations for the platform's health-data processing.

#### [art22_alerting_analysis.md](./compliance/art22_alerting_analysis.md)
GDPR Article 22 analysis of the alerting/severity-routing chain — whether automated alert decisions constitute solely automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effect, and the safeguards applied.

#### [alerting_algorithm_card.md](./compliance/alerting_algorithm_card.md)
Shipped alerting logic in one place: 30% of mean, 2σ with 5 bpm floor, 5%/week × 4, 80% coverage, provisional never alerts, named SSA engine, MedGemma interprets only.
