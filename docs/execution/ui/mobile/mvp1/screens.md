## POC Screens

Five MVP 1 screens selected to validate the core design language — covering branding, the primary monitoring experience, the alert management system, and critical safety interactions.

| # | Screen | Why It's Here |
|---|--------|---------------|
| 1 | **M1-02 — Welcome / Landing** | Entry point; showcases brand identity, hero carousel, and marketing tone |
| 2 | **M1-04 — Add First CardiMember** | Onboarding form; demonstrates photo picker, progressive disclosure, and inline privacy messaging |
| 3 | **M1-09 — Main Dashboard** | Core monitoring screen; shows status hero card, 3-metric layout, severity color system, and sparklines |
| 4 | **M1-10 — Alerts List** | Alert management; demonstrates severity badges, grouped list design, filter chips, and swipe actions |
| 5 | **M1-12 — Alert Detail - Critical** | Highest-stakes screen; validates urgency design, pulsing severity treatment, and primary CTA hierarchy |

These five screens span onboarding → daily use → emergency response and collectively exercise the full design system: typography, color severity levels, card components, form patterns, and navigation affordances.
