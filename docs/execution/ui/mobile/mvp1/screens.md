# CardiTrack - MVP 1 Screen Specifications

> **Extract — do not edit directly.** This file is extracted from the canonical [ui_screens_maui_mobile.md](../ui_screens_maui_mobile.md) (v3.1); make changes there and re-extract. Release sequencing is governed by the [release matrix](../../../../release_matrix.md).

## Build Status (as of August 9, 2026)

> **All 17 Figma M1 screens are built** in `CardiTrack.Mobile` (M1-01 through M1-10, plus M1-11/M1-12/M1-16 Alert Details — one `AlertDetailPage` branching on rule and severity — M1-13 CardiMemberDetailPage, M1-14 EditCardiMemberPage, M1-15 DeviceManagementPage, and M1-17 ExportHealthDataPage). Anything else unbuilt shows a "Coming soon" dialog, except the dashboard's Add-Member action, which pushes M1-04 (AddCardiMemberPage) directly. **Four shipped screens have no Figma M1 frame — needs design sync:** SignInPage, ForgotPasswordPage, VerifyEmailPage, Onboarding/AccountSetupPage (specs in the canonical doc). Unbuilt screens below remain design intent, each marked with a status line.

---

## What MVP 1 Delivers

A single user can sign up, add a CardiMember, connect devices, manage CardiMember profiles, view the health dashboard, receive and manage all alert types, and export health data in PDF, CSV, or FHIR R4 format. This is the essential monitoring loop — everything needed for the app to be useful from day one. MVP 1 monitors **one CardiMember** — the multi-member dashboard (M3-03) is an MVP 2 feature, and the shipped dashboard displays only the first active member.

## User Flows

### Flow 1: First-Time Onboarding

As built: Welcome's only affordances lead to Sign Up; SignInPage is reached from CreateAccount's "Already have an account? Sign In" link. Email verification (VerifyEmailPage) gates entry, then PostLoginRouter routes to AccountSetupPage (if account type not yet set) or AddCardiMemberPage. Onboarding pages hide the tab bar (`Shell.TabBarIsVisible=False`).

## Navigation Structure

### Bottom Tab Bar (always visible)

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                    │
│          Content Area              │
│                                    │
├──────────┬──────────┬────────┬────────┤
│ Dashboard│  Alerts  │Journal │Settings│
└──────────┴──────────┴────────┴────────┘
```

- Badge count on Alerts tab for unread alerts
- **The third tab is the Journal (CardiJournal), not Family.** The Family tab held a "coming soon" stub for invitations that are R3 work; `FamilyPage` is deleted and `JournalPage` (the CardiJournal, listing Daybook, Weekbook and Monthbook entries behind a Days / Weeks / Months control) took the slot. When family sharing lands it belongs under Settings or scoped to a member, not back in the bar
- As built, the Shell defines a **TabBar only** (Dashboard / Alerts / Journal / Settings, SVG icons). Alerts opens the real M1-10 list; the Journal lists the Daybook, Weekbook and Monthbook entries; Settings is minimal (account card, "More settings (M2-01) coming soon", Sign out). Onboarding pages hide the tab bar via `Shell.TabBarIsVisible=False`.

### Flyout Menu

**Not built — there is no flyout menu in the shipped app.** The Shell is TabBar-only, with no edge-swipe flyout. The flyout concept below is retired unless re-introduced through Figma:

- ~~User profile header, Dashboard, CardiMembers, Alerts, Family & Sharing, Subscription, Settings, Help & Support, Sign Out~~

### Gesture Patterns

| Gesture | Context | Action | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Pull down | Dashboard (and future scrollable screens) | Refresh data | **Shipped** (Dashboard) |
| Swipe left | List items | Reveal quick actions | Planned (no list-item swipes shipped) |
| Swipe right | List items | Reveal secondary actions | Planned (no list-item swipes shipped) |
| Pinch | Chart views | Zoom in/out | Planned (no chart gestures shipped) |
| Long press | Chart data points | Show tooltip | Planned (no chart gestures shipped) |
| Long press | CardiMember photo | Change photo | Superseded — shipped as a **tap** on the M1-04 / M1-14 avatar, opening the photo action sheet |

There is no edge-swipe flyout gesture (no flyout exists).

## POC Screens

Five MVP 1 screens selected to validate the core design language — covering branding, the primary monitoring experience, the alert management system, and critical safety interactions.

| # | Screen | Why It's Here |
|---|--------|---------------|
| 1 | **M1-02 — Welcome / Landing** | Entry point; showcases brand identity, hero carousel, and marketing tone |
| 2 | **M1-04 — Add First CardiMember** | Onboarding form; demonstrates photo picker, progressive disclosure, and inline privacy messaging |
| 3 | **M1-09 — Main Dashboard** | Core monitoring screen; shows status hero card, key-metric grid, severity color system, and star ratings |
| 4 | **M1-10 — Alerts List** | Alert management; demonstrates severity badges, grouped list design, filter chips, and swipe actions |
| 5 | **M1-12 — Alert Detail - Critical** | Highest-stakes screen; validates urgency design, pulsing severity treatment, and primary CTA hierarchy |

These five screens span onboarding → daily use → emergency response. **Build status:** M1-02, M1-04, M1-09, M1-10, **and M1-12** are built — `AlertDetailPage` covers the emergency-response design language for red / no-morning-activity alerts.

---

## Screens

### M1-01: Splash Screen
**Status:** Built (`SplashPage`)
**User Story:** 1.1-1.3 Onboarding
**Entry:** App launch
**Exit:** → M1-02 Welcome (first launch) | → M1-09 Dashboard (returning user) | → M4-02 Biometric Login (MVP 3, if enabled)

**Duration:** 2-3 seconds while app initializes

**Layout:**
- Full-screen gradient background (CardiTrack brand colors)
- Large CardiTrack logo (centered)
- App name beneath logo
- Loading spinner (bottom third)
- Version number (bottom, small text)

**States:**
- **M1-01a — Default:** Logo + spinner animation
- **M1-01b — Error:** If initialization fails → "Hmm, something didn't work. Tap to try again." with retry button

---

### M1-02: Welcome / Landing Screen
**Status:** Built (`WelcomePage`)
**User Story:** 1.1 First-Time Registration
**Entry:** ← M1-01 Splash (first launch only)
**Exit:** → M1-03 Sign Up (primary CTA and top-right "Sign up" — same destination). There is **no Sign In affordance on Welcome**; sign-in is reached via CreateAccount's "Already have an account? Sign In" link.

**Layout:**

**Header (top 20%):**
- CardiTrack logo (top-left, small)
- "Sign up" label (top-right) → M1-03 (same destination as primary CTA)

**Hero Carousel (middle 50%):**
- 3 swipeable slides with pagination dots:

| Slide | Illustration | Headline | Subtext |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Happy elderly person with smartwatch | "Know They're Okay" | "Stay close to the people you love — even from far away" |
| 2 | Phone showing health dashboard | "Their Watch, Your Peace" | "Connects with Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin & more" |
| 3 | Family members on phones | "Care Together" | "Share the watch with your siblings — you're not in this alone" |

**CTA Section (bottom 30%):**
- Primary button (full width, bold): "Start Free 30-Day Trial"
- Pricing text (small, muted): "Then from $7/month - Cancel anytime"
- Secondary button (text style, subtle): "Sign In"
- Legal link (small): "By continuing, you agree to Terms & Privacy"

**Interactions:**
- Carousel is **swipe-only** (`Loop=False`, no auto-advance)
- Pagination dots indicate current slide
- Swipe left/right between slides
- Terms & Privacy link is a **stub** — shows a placeholder alert ("Terms and privacy will open here.")

---

### M1-03: Sign Up Screen
**Status:** Built (`CreateAccountPage`)
**User Story:** 1.1 Account Creation
**Entry:** ← M1-02 Welcome ("Start Free Trial" or "Sign up")
**Exit:** → VerifyEmailPage (success; email verification gate) → PostLoginRouter → AccountSetupPage or M1-04 Add CardiMember | → SignInPage ("Already have an account? Sign In")

**Header:**
- Gradient header (no back button)
- Title: "Create Account"
- Progress indicator: "Step 1 of 4"

**Form (scrollable):**

- **First field is required "Full Name"** — text input
- Label: "Email Address"
  - Text input, email keyboard, autocapitalization off
- Label: "Password"
  - Password input (masked)
  - Password strength bar below (weak → medium → strong)
  - Strength label: "Weak" / "Medium" / "Strong"
- Label: "Confirm Password"
  - Password input (masked)

**Terms:**
- Checkbox + label: "I agree to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy"
- "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" are tappable links

**CTA:**
- Primary button: "Create Account" — **never disabled**; tapping while invalid runs validation and shows inline errors; the button's gradient swaps to the active treatment when the form becomes valid
- Error banner area (reserved for weak-password, network, and generic errors)

**Divider (below CTA):** Horizontal line with "Or continue with" centered

**Social Login (2-up icon grid):**
- "Google" card (white background, Google logo)
- "Apple" card (dark background, Apple logo)
- **Wired** — Google/Apple sign-in via Auth0's PKCE authorization-code flow in the system browser on Android/iOS; the Windows target falls back to an error message

**Bottom:**
- Link: "Already have an account? Sign In" → SignInPage

**Validation Rules:**
- Full Name: required
- Email: valid format, real-time feedback
- Password: min 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 number
- Confirm password: must match
- Terms checkbox: must be checked

**States:**
- **M1-03a — Default:** Empty form
- **M1-03b — Validating:** Inline error messages appear beneath invalid fields
- **M1-03c — Loading:** Button shows spinner, form disabled
- **M1-03d — Error:** **Duplicate email shows as an inline field error under Email**; the top error banner is reserved for weak-password, network, and generic failures

**Post-signup:** Success pushes **VerifyEmailPage** (the email-verification gate); after verification, PostLoginRouter routes to AccountSetupPage (account type not yet set) or M1-04 AddCardiMemberPage.

---

### M1-04: Add First CardiMember
**Status:** Built (`Onboarding/AddCardiMemberPage`)
**User Story:** 1.2 Adding First CardiMember
**Entry:** ← M1-03 Sign Up (success, after VerifyEmailPage/PostLoginRouter) | ← M1-09 Dashboard (Add-Member action pushes this page directly)
**Exit:** → M1-05 Device Selection ("Continue") | → M1-09 Dashboard ("Skip for Now"; when pushed from the dashboard, Skip pops back to it)

**Header:**
- Title: "Add First CardiMember"
- Progress indicator: "Step 2 of 4"

**Introduction:**
- Icon: person silhouette
- Text: "Who would you like to look after?"
- Subtext: "Tell us who you're looking after — we'll take it from there"

**Photo Section:**
- Circular photo placeholder (large)
- "Add Photo" button below
- Tapping either opens the photo action sheet: "Take a photo" (`MediaPicker.CapturePhotoAsync`; hidden where capture isn't supported), "Choose from library" (`MediaPicker.PickPhotosAsync`), and "Remove photo" once one is set. The photo is downscaled on device (longest edge ≤ 1280 px, JPEG) and sent as `photoBase64` on submit; if it can't be prepared the form offers "Continue without photo" rather than blocking the member.

**Required Fields:**
- "Full Name *" — text input
- "Date of Birth *" — date picker (format: MM/DD/YYYY)
  - As built, **DOB silently defaults to today** if not changed — not validated (known limitation)
- "Sex *" — picker (Male / Female), helper text: "Helps us read heart rate and sleep against the right range."
  - **Deliberate divergence from the Figma M1-04/M1-13 comps** — the field is not in the design file but ships because DOB + sex set the reference range the summaries are read against; do not drop it on a pixel-match pass

**Optional Field:**
- "Relationship" — dropdown picker (no asterisk): Parent, Grandparent, Spouse, Sibling, Other — an unpicked relationship falls back to `Other`

**Optional Fields (collapsible section):**
- Toggle: "Add More Details (Optional)"
- When expanded:
  - "Medical Notes" — multi-line text (max 500 chars, character counter shown)
    - Encrypted indicator icon visible
  - "Emergency Contact Name" — text input
  - "Emergency Contact Phone" — phone keyboard input
    - Placeholder is localized by device region (PR #8): US/CA "+1 555 000 0000", GB "+44 7700 900000"; **all other regions fall back to the US format** — worth noting given the product's US + EU framing

**Privacy Notice:**
- ~~Info card with lock icon: "[Name] will know you're looking out for them and can give their okay"~~
- **Not built** — the shipped screen has no privacy-notice card (product follow-up, relevant to the consent-first principle)

**CTA:**
- Primary button: "Continue" — enabled by **name ≥ 2 characters + sex selected** only
- Text link: "Skip for now"

**Draft persistence:** a half-typed member (and its photo) survives app backgrounding — the form saves to `CardiMemberDraftStore` on background/stop and restores on return; the draft is cleared on successful submit.

**States:**
- **M1-04a — Default:** Empty form with photo placeholder
- **M1-04b — Photo added:** Shows uploaded image in circle
- **M1-04c — Loading:** Button shows spinner on submit

---

### M1-05: Device Connection - Selection
**Status:** Built (`Onboarding/DeviceSelectionPage`)
**User Story:** 1.3 Device Connection Wizard
**Entry:** ← M1-04 Add CardiMember ("Continue")
**Exit:** → M1-06 OAuth Permission ("Continue with [Device]")

**Header:**
- Back button
- Title: "Connect Device"
- Progress indicator: "Step 3 of 4"

**Introduction:**
- Heading: "What does [Name] wear?" (member name interpolated)
- Subtext: "We'll connect with their device to keep you in the loop"

**Device Grid (fixed 2-column grid):**

Each device card:
- Rounded frame with shadow
- Device logo (medium)
- Device name (bold)
- "Coming Soon" badge for future devices
- Coming Soon cards render at **0.55 opacity** and are non-tappable

**Supported Devices (MVP 1 — Fitbit and Google Pixel Watch, both via the Google Health API; remaining devices shown as Coming Soon):**

| Device | Card text (models) | MVP Availability |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Fitbit | Charge, Versa, Sense series | **MVP 1** |
| Google Pixel Watch | Pixel Watch 1–3 | **MVP 1** |
| Garmin | Venu, Forerunner, etc. | MVP 2 (shown Coming Soon) |
| Apple Watch | Series 4+ | Via Google Health — should route to the Google Health connect flow once the brand is mapped (decided 2026-09-05; shown Coming Soon until then) |
| Samsung Galaxy | All models | Via Google Health — same as Apple Watch |
| Withings | ScanWatch, Move | Coming Soon (R4) |
| Other | All models | Coming Soon |

**Bottom:**
- Link: "Don't see their device? We can help"

**Interactions:**
- **Fitbit and Google Pixel Watch are selectable** (single-select; Fitbit is preselected on entry) — re-tapping the selected card clears the selection, and there is no auto-advance
- Explicit primary button: **"Continue with [Device]"** proceeds to M1-06; reads "Continue" and disables while nothing is selected
- Coming Soon cards are greyed out (0.55 opacity) with "Coming Soon" badges

### M1-06: Device Connection - OAuth Permission
**Status:** Built (`Onboarding/DeviceConnectionPage`) — brand-agnostic; the selected device supplies the copy, logo, and wire name
**User Story:** 1.3 OAuth Flow
**Entry:** ← M1-05 Device Selection ("Continue with [Device]")
**Exit:** → M1-07 Success (authorization complete) | ← M1-05 Device Selection ("Cancel")

**Header:**
- Back button
- Title: "[Device] Connection" (device name interpolated)

**Visual Connection (centered):**
- Heading: "Connect Your [Device]"
- Large device logo (interpolated per device)
- Arrow/connection icon
- Large CardiTrack logo

**Permission List:**
- Label: "To look after [Name], CardiTrack needs:" (member name interpolated)
- Each permission in its own row:

| Icon | Permission | Info Tooltip |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Heart | Heart Rate Data | "So we can spot if something's off" |
| Shoe | Activity & Steps | "To make sure they're staying active" |
| Moon | Sleep Data | "To know they're resting well" |

- Each row has an (i) info button that shows the tooltip on tap

**Privacy Notice:**
- Card with light background
- Lock icon + text: "Your family's health data stays private always. We never sell or share it with third parties."

**CTA:**
- Primary button: "Authorize [Device Name]"
  - Tap opens device's OAuth login in a browser/webview
- Text link: "Cancel"

**States:**
- **M1-06a — Default:** Permission list visible
- **M1-06b — Authorizing:** Loading overlay with "Connecting to [Name]'s [Device]..." message
- **M1-06c — Error:** "We couldn't connect — let's try that again" with retry button

> **State-letter mismatch:** the shipped code maps **B = Error** and **C = Authorizing overlay** — the reverse of the lettering above. Figma is the arbiter of state letters; the code should be realigned (or the Figma frame updated) at the next design sync.

### M1-07: Device Connection - Success
**Status:** Built (`Onboarding/ConnectionSuccessPage`)
**User Story:** 1.3 Connection Success
**Entry:** ← M1-06 OAuth (authorization complete)
**Exit:** → M1-08 Baseline Info ("Continue to Dashboard", first device only) | → wizard exit ("Done", additional device) | → M1-05 Device Selection ("Add Another Device")

**Checkmark:**
- **Static green circle with ✓** (no entry animation shipped)

**Success Message:**
- Heading: "You're all set!"
- Text: `$"{name}'s {device.DisplayName} is now connected"` (member name + selected device)
- Subtext: "We're pulling in their latest data — just a moment"

**Data Preview Card:**
- Title: "Latest Data" with **"SYNCING" badge**
- Rows:
  - Steps Today: 4,250
  - Last Synced: Just now
  - Heart Rate: 72 bpm

**Options:**
- Outlined button: "+ Add Another Device"

**CTA:**
- Primary button: "Continue to Dashboard" — connecting the member's **first** device; continues to M1-08
- Primary button: **"Done"** — connecting an **additional** device (launched from M1-15 for a member who already had one); exits the wizard straight back to where it was launched from. M1-08 is the 30-day learning story, which is news once per member, not once per device; the label changes with it because this exit does not land on the dashboard.
- Which of the two shows is fixed when the wizard opens, by whether the member had a device then — so a run that starts from none and connects two via "Add Another Device" still ends on M1-08.
- Helper text **below the button**: "You can sync multiple devices to get a more accurate picture of their health."

**States:**
- **M1-07a — Syncing:** Preview card shows shimmer/skeleton loading
- **M1-07b — Synced:** Preview card shows real data
- **M1-07c — Partial sync:** Some values show, others show "Syncing..."

### M1-08: Baseline Learning Info
**Status:** Built (`Onboarding/BaselineLearningPage`)
**User Story:** 1.3 Baseline Setup
**Entry:** ← M1-07 Device Success — **first connected device only**; skipped when an additional device is added (see M1-07 CTA)
**Exit:** → M1-09 Dashboard ("Go to Dashboard") | "Invite Family Member First" link (ships now; dead end until M3-02)

**Header:**
- Title: "Learning Phase"
- Progress indicator: "Step 4 of 4"

**Illustration:**
- Static emoji glyphs: 🧠⚙ (no Lottie animation shipped)

**Explanation:**
- Heading: "Getting to know them" (singular, no name interpolation)
- Body: "Over the next 30 days, CardiTrack will learn what a normal day looks like for them:"
- Bullet list:
  - "When they usually wake up and go to sleep"
  - "How active they are day to day"
  - "What their resting heart rate looks like"

**Progress:**
- Progress bar: "Day 1 of 30"
- Label: "3% Complete"

**Options Card:**
- Toggle switch: "Keep me posted while CardiTrack is learning"
- Description: "You'll get basic alerts right away (like heart rate over 100)"

**CTA:**
- Primary button: "Go to Dashboard"
- Text link: "Invite Family Member First" — **ships now in MVP 1** (unconditional), but the invite flow (M3-02) does not exist yet, so the link is currently a dead end. Not an MVP 2 addition.

### M1-09: Main Dashboard (Single CardiMember)
**Status:** Built (`DashboardPage`)
**User Story:** 2.1 Daily Health Overview
**Entry:** Tab bar (Home) | ← M1-08 Baseline Info (first time)
**Exit:** → M1-10 Alerts List | → M2-03 Trend Charts | → M1-13 CardiMember Detail | → Phone call / SMS

**Header (fixed):**
- Greeting: "Good Morning, [User First Name]"
- Notification bell icon (with unread badge count)
- Refresh icon (pull-to-refresh also supported)

**Status Hero Card:**
- Large card with gradient background colored by status
- CardiMember photo (circular, large)
- Name and age: "[Name], 78"
- Large status indicator:

| Status | Label | Icon |
|--------|-------|------|
| Normal | "[Name] is doing well" | Checkmark |
| Caution | "Something looks a little different" | Warning triangle |
| Urgent | "You should check in" | Lightning bolt |
| Critical | "Reach out to [Name] now" | Siren |
| Paused | "Monitoring is paused for [Name]" | Pause |

- Last synced: "Updated 10 minutes ago"
- Tap sync icon for manual refresh
- **Tap the card body → M1-13 CardiMember Detail**
- The Paused row is outside the green/yellow/orange/red severity scale on purpose: it says "we are not watching", not "we looked and it's fine"

**Quick Actions Row (4 tiles):**
- "SOS" (red treatment, leads the row) → dials the **emergency contact number, not the CardiMember**
- "Call" (phone icon) → initiates phone call
- "Message" (SMS icon) → opens SMS
- "Details" (chart icon) → navigates to M1-13 (as does tapping the hero card)

**Key Metrics (collapsible "Key Metrics" `AccordionSection` — 2-column grid of up to six `MetricCard`s):**

Heart Rate, Sleep, Skin Temp, Steps, SpO2, and Breathing Rate — the last three are **visibility-gated on the device having a reading**, and the grid re-packs at render time so no tile is left beside a gap.

> **Two further metrics now arrive on the payload with no card.** `heartRateVariability` and `overnightBreathingRate` were added to `DashboardMetrics` on 2026-08-22 (see [health-data.md](../../../backend/api/health-data.md)) and are rendered nowhere: each card needs a hand-authored icon and a Figma slot, exactly as the four body readings below do. Unlike SpO2 and Breathing Rate, both **do** carry a learned baseline, so they would earn a star row if they were ever given a card. Detailed per-metric history remains M2-03.

**Star rating (1-5)** appears on Activity, Heart Rate and Sleep: how the reading sits against this member's own normal — except sleep, which is also held to the published recommended band for the member's age, because a habitually short sleeper's own normal is the very reading being watched for. The row takes the status pill's colour on the card whose pill is built from `status` (Heart Rate) and colours itself from the star count (3-5 green, 2 yellow, 1 orange) elsewhere — Activity, which shows no pill, and Sleep, whose GOOD/FAIR/POOR pill is itself named from those bands — never from a status the card isn't showing, which is what would paint a short sleeper's two stars green. Skin Temp shows no star row: its rating is derived from the same per-day deviation as its status one band finer, so under a NORMAL pill the stars could only restate the pill. SpO2 and Breathing Rate have no baseline yet, so no stars either — but each carries the one comparison it does have: a NORMAL/UNUSUAL pill read against the published reference band the payload already ships (WHO's 94-100% and 12-20 brpm), with the caption naming the band and its publisher ("94-100% typical (WHO)") so NORMAL on those cards never claims a baseline the metric does not have. Only those two words — grading how far outside a population band a reading sits is the alert pipeline's judgement, not a tile's. See `qualityScore` and `reference` in [health-data.md](../../../backend/api/health-data.md).

**Change against normal** rides on the reading itself — "5,959 steps  ↑63%" — an arrow for the direction and the distance as a percent, green up and red down, at 13sp beside the 18sp value. It states the change, not the reading as a share of normal ("163%"), which is what the card used to print on its own line with "of normal" under it. The value and the percentage are two spans of one wrapping label, so a tile too narrow for both drops the percentage to a second line and grows to hold it rather than clipping the reading.

The comparison is the member's own baseline (`changePercent`) on every card but Activity, which compares with the day its bar and caption already name — steps accumulate, so the payload leaves `changePercent` unset while the day is running (see `MemberInsightsCalculator`) and a tile that only showed a percentage after midnight showed one almost never. Everything on the Activity tile therefore answers "against the day before" except its star row, which stays the rating against their usual day.

Whole percent from 1% up, a tenth below it ("↓0.3%"): a skin temperature 0.1°C off a 33.8°C baseline is a real movement its own caption states in degrees, and rounding to whole percent would drop it. Nothing is drawn where there is no comparison to make (SpO2 and Breathing Rate have no baseline; Activity has no previous day, or a previous day of zero, which no percentage can express), or where the movement rounds to 0% at that tenth.

**Status pill placement:** the pill (NORMAL / UNUSUAL, and Sleep's GOOD / FAIR / POOR) sits in the tile's top-right corner, opposite the metric icon, with the name on the row beneath. At half-grid width a name and a pill do not fit side by side, and the alternative was truncating "Heart Rate" to make room for NORMAL. **Tile corners** are 12, not the shared `OutlinedCard` 20 — a radius drawn for a full-width card takes a visible bite out of a tile this size.

**Card 1: Activity**
- Icon: shoe
- Large value: "4,250 steps"
- Visual progress bar — today against the previous calendar day's total, not a goal (the track's max grows to today once today is ahead; two stacked colours when it is)
- Movement sits on the value line itself (see **Change against normal** above), against the previous day rather than the baseline: "8,846 steps  ↑48%" over "vs 5,959 yesterday"
- Star rating (1-5) — the shortfall against normal; walking further than usual is not marked down

**Card 2: Heart Rate**
- Icon: heart
- Large value: "72 bpm"
- Status: "Normal range"
- Star rating (1-5) — deviation from normal in either direction
- Range text: "68-75 bpm typical"

**Card 3: Sleep**
- Icon: moon
- Large value: "7.2 hours"
- Status pill: **GOOD / FAIR / POOR** — one word naming the band of the star rating (3-5 / 2 / 1), in the same pill chrome and status colours as the other cards; hidden when the night is unrated. From the rating, never from `status`: a quality vocabulary rather than NORMAL/UNUSUAL, because a 4.5-hour night is entirely usual for a member who always sleeps 4.5 hours — and still FAIR
- Star rating (1-5) — the worse of sleep efficiency and the shortfall in duration against baseline (either alone when the other is unavailable), capped on the length of the night against the published band for the member's age — both ends, so neither 4.5 nor 12 hours can rate five stars
- Caption: "Last night" once the percentage beside the value states the direction; "Longer than usual" / "Shorter than usual" / "In line with usual" when it does not — direction only, no verdict; the stars and pill carry the judgement

**Recent Alerts (conditional — only shown if alerts exist):**
- Section heading: "Recent Alerts"
- Horizontal scrollable alert cards
- Each card: icon, title, time, status
- Tap any card → M1-11 or M1-12 Alert Detail

**Verify-Email Nudge (conditional):**
- Dismissible banner prompting the user to verify their email address

**Bottom:**
- Button: "View Trends & History" → M2-03 _(MVP 2)_

**Interactions:**
- Pull-to-refresh triggers data sync; manual refresh icon sits in the page **header**
- ~~Swipe left on metric card → see detail view~~ (not shipped — no metric-card swipe gesture)
- ~~Long-press on photo → change photo option~~ (shipped as a tap on the Edit Profile (M1-14) avatar instead — no dashboard long-press gesture)

**States (8 as built):**
- **M1-09a — Loading:** Skeleton/shimmer cards
- **M1-09b — Normal:** Full data displayed
- **M1-09c — Stale data / offline:** Cached data with banner: "Last update was X hours ago — pull down to check in". **Suppressed while monitoring is paused** — the data is meant to be stale then, and "pull down to check in" is advice the app can't honour.
- **Monitoring paused:** amber banner naming the resume time; hero shows the paused status
- **M1-09d — No device connected:** Prompt card: "Connect [Name]'s device so CardiTrack can start watching over them" → M1-05
- **M1-09e — Baseline learning:** Shows progress bar instead of "% of normal" comparisons
- **Refresh / sync-error:** RefreshView in-flight state, plus sync-error surface
- **Error:** "We couldn't load the dashboard" + "Try again" button
- **No CardiMember:** "Who are you watching over?" + "Add CardiMember" button → pushes M1-04 (AddCardiMemberPage) directly; its Skip pops back here

**Single-member only:** the dashboard shows the **first `IsActive` CardiMember** (cached in Preferences); there is no member switcher. Multi-member is deferred to M3-03 (MVP 2).

---

### M1-10: Alerts List
**Status:** Built (`AlertsPage`, with `FilterChipBar` and `AlertListCard`)
**User Story:** 3.1 Alert Management | 3.3 Alert Acknowledgment & Notes
**Entry:** Tab bar (Alerts) | ← M1-09 Dashboard (Recent Alerts)
**Exit:** → M1-11 Alert Detail (Activity) | → M1-12 Alert Detail (Critical) | → Phone call

**Header:**
- Title: "Alerts"
- Filter icon (funnel)
- Settings icon (gear) → M2-04 Notification Settings _(MVP 2)_

**Filter Chips (horizontal scroll):**
- [All] [Unread] [Critical] [Today] [This Week]

**Alert List (grouped by date):**

Section headers: "Today" / "Yesterday" / "This Week" / "Older"

**Alert Card Layout:**
- Left border colored by severity
- Top row:
  - Severity badge: "CRITICAL" / "URGENT" / "INFO"
  - Timestamp: "2 hours ago"
  - Unread dot (if unread)
- Content:
  - CardiMember name + small photo (inline)
  - Alert title (bold): e.g., "Low Activity Detected"
  - Preview text (2 lines max): "Dad hasn't moved this morning. He usually wakes up around..."
- Bottom row:
  - Status label: "New" / "Acknowledged" / "Resolved"
  - Quick action icons: Call (phone) | Acknowledge (checkmark) | Expand (chevron)

**Swipe Actions:**
- Swipe right → "Acknowledge"
- Swipe left → "Call"

**Bottom:**
- Link: "View Archived Alerts"

**States:**
- **M1-10a — Default:** Grouped alert list
- **M1-10b — Empty:** Large bell icon (muted) + "Nothing to worry about" + "CardiTrack is keeping an eye on things — we'll let you know if anything comes up"
- **M1-10c — Filtered empty:** "No alerts match this filter"
- **M1-10d — Loading:** Skeleton cards

Heart rate alerts tap → M1-16

**As built** — backed by `GET /api/v1/alerts` and `POST /api/v1/alerts/{id}/acknowledge` (see [alerts.md](../../../backend/api/alerts.md)), listing every CardiMember the caregiver may read, newest first. Differences from the frames, each deliberate:

- **Header is as drawn** — back arrow, title, filter button. Alerts is a tab root, so the arrow goes to M1-09 rather than popping a stack that isn't there. The filter button offers the same five filters as a sheet, which is why M1-10b keeps it while dropping the chip row.
- **Chips are M1-10a's set in M1-10c's styling.** The frames disagree — M1-10a has [All] [Unread] [Critical] [Today] [This Week] as plain pills, M1-10c has [Recent] [High Priority] [Heart Rate] [Oxygen] with dropdown carets. The set is M1-10a's (the one this spec documents, and the one every chip can actually filter — there is no SpO2 alert type); the pill, caret and spacing are M1-10c's.
- **Loading is built as drawn** — the "Syncing with Device… / Refresh Now" card over four structured skeleton rows (`AlertSkeletonCard`, whose shimmer blocks sit where the avatar, badge, title and status pill will land). Refresh Now supersedes the in-flight request rather than being swallowed by it, so the button works in the one state it appears in.
- **Severity badges are severity-coloured.** Wording follows this spec (CRITICAL / URGENT / INFO); the colour follows the app's own scale, so a yellow alert can't show a yellow rail beside Figma's blue "Info" chip.
- **The chevron expands the card in place.** Kept from when M1-11 / M1-12 / M1-16 did not exist: expanding reveals the full message without leaving the list, which is still the faster read when scanning several alerts. The detail screen is reachable by tapping the card itself.
- **"View Archived Alerts" switches this list to resolved alerts** rather than pushing an archive screen, and flips back the same way. The chip row hides while archived — it is a different list, not a narrower one.
- **Avatars show the member's photo when one is set** (`cardiMemberPhotoUrl`, a short-lived signed URL), falling back to initials.
- **Swipe actions are not implemented.** The card's inline Call and Acknowledge buttons cover both gestures.

### M1-11: Alert Detail - Activity
**Status:** ✅ Built — `AlertDetailPage`. One page serves M1-11, M1-12 and M1-16; sections are shown
by the alert's rule and severity rather than by three near-identical screens. Divergences from the
design intent below are called out inline.
**User Story:** 11.1 Activity Decline | 3.3 Alert Acknowledgment & Notes
**Entry:** ← M1-10 Alerts List (tap alert card)
**Exit:** ← M1-10 Alerts List (back) | → Phone call | → SMS | → M2-03 Trend Charts

**Header:**
- Back button
- Title: "Alert Details"
- Share button

**Alert Header Card:**
- Caution-level severity banner
- ~~Warning icon~~ — _as built:_ a **reason** icon (steps / heart / sleep / watch), in a
  translucent-white tile with white-stroke artwork. Severity is already the banner's colour, so a
  second severity glyph says nothing new — and the one it replaced was stroked in the severity
  colour, which on the yellow and orange banners made it invisible against its own ground.
- Title: "Low Activity Alert"
- CardiMember photo + name
- Timestamp: "January 10, 2026 at 11:30 AM"

**Description:**
- Card with icon
- Large readable text: "Dad hasn't been as active as usual lately"

**Mini Trend Chart:**
- 2-week activity trend showing declining line
- Baseline range shaded, current data overlaid
- _As built:_ the headline figure is the last **finished** day and says which day it is; today is
  drawn as a dashed run, unmarked (the day markers belong to the readings the window is made of,
  and a running total is not one of them), with a caption comparing it to the same elapsed stretch
  of yesterday ("865 steps so far today, 22% below the 1,102 by this time yesterday"). Plotting a
  running total beside completed days made a normal lunchtime read as a collapse. See
  `AlertChartResponse.partialDayLabel` in the alerts API doc.

**Comparison Card (2-column grid):**

| Current | Normal |
|---------|--------|
| "Recent Average" | "Normal Average" |
| 2,500 steps/day | 5,000 steps/day |

- Full-width highlighted row: "-50% below normal"

**Context Card:**
- Lightbulb icon
- "Here's what might be going on:"
  - They could be feeling under the weather
  - They might be in pain or uncomfortable
  - They may be feeling low or tired

**Recommended Actions** — _as built:_ the Dashboard's SOS / Call / Message / Details quick-action
row (`Controls/QuickActionRow`), not the three full-width buttons below. One control, so the two
screens cannot drift into offering the same actions with different wording and different
availability rules. "Book a Doctor Visit" is not offered at all — no clinician or booking
architecture exists.

1. ~~"Give Dad a Call" (primary, phone icon)~~ → Call tile
2. ~~"Send a Quick Message" (secondary, SMS icon)~~ → Message tile
3. ~~"Book a Doctor Visit" (secondary, calendar icon)~~ → not built

**More Options** — _as built:_ only the rows with a backend behind them.
- ~~"Adjust Baseline" (if this is a new normal)~~ — no baseline-override endpoint
- ~~"Add Note About This Alert"~~ — no `AlertNote` store
- "Share with Family" — OS share sheet, carrying only the title, time and first name already on
  screen; no metric values
- "View Detailed Activity Data" → M1-13 (moved up from the bottom of the screen)

**Acknowledgment Section:**
- If unread: Button "Mark as Acknowledged" ("I'm on my way" on a critical alert)
- If acknowledged: "Acknowledged by Sarah, 30 min ago", plus **"Undo — mark as not handled"**
  (`DELETE /alerts/{id}/acknowledge`). Acknowledging is a claim a caregiver makes about themselves
  and they can make it by accident; the undo persists on the screen rather than living in a toast
  that is gone by the time they notice. Not offered once the system has *resolved* the alert.
  Notes are not built.

---

### M1-12: Alert Detail - Critical (No Movement)
**Status:** Built (`AlertDetailPage`) — `no_morning_activity` and red alerts; Call now + I'm on my way. Family-notify and notes are still not built.
**User Story:** 11.3 No Morning Activity | 3.3 Alert Acknowledgment & Notes
**Entry:** ← M1-10 Alerts List | Push notification (direct)
**Exit:** ← M1-10 Alerts List (back) | → Phone call | → Note input

This is the most safety-critical screen in the app. Design for urgency and immediate action.

**Alert Header:**
- Full-width critical severity banner (pulsing animation)
- Large siren icon
- Title: "We haven't seen Dad move today"
- CardiMember photo + name
- Timestamp

**Urgent Message Card (thick border, critical severity):**
- Large text: "Dad hasn't moved this morning"
- Details:
  - "He usually wakes up around 7:00 AM"
  - "It's now 11:00 AM"
  - "That's 4 hours with no movement"

**Last Known Activity Card:**
- "The last time we saw Dad move:"
- "Yesterday at 10:30 PM"
- "Bedroom area (based on his device)"

**Immediate Actions (large, prominent buttons):**
1. **"CALL NOW"** — critical severity, oversized, phone icon, one-tap to dial, shows phone number
2. **"I'M ON MY WAY"** — urgent severity, large — updates status and lets your family know

**Dismissal Option:**
- Button: "It's okay — he told me he'd sleep in"
  - Opens a note field for context
  - Dismisses alert with explanation logged

**Family Notification Card:**
- "Your family has been notified too:"
  - Sarah (via SMS) — timestamp
  - John (via Push) — timestamp

**Event Timeline:**
- Vertical timeline:
  - 10:30 PM — Last movement
  - 7:00 AM — Expected wake time
  - 9:00 AM — Alert threshold reached
  - 11:30 AM — You were notified

---

### M1-13: CardiMember Detail
**Status:** Built (`CardiMemberDetailPage`)
**User Story:** 1.4 CardiMember Profile Management
**Entry:** ← M1-09 Dashboard (hero card tap **or** "View Details") | ← M2-01 Settings ("Manage CardiMembers") _(MVP 2)_
**Exit:** ← Previous screen (back) | → M1-14 Edit CardiMember | → M1-15 Device Management | → M1-09 Dashboard | → M1-10 Alerts

Backed by a single `GET /api/v1/cardimembers/{id}` round trip — see [cardimembers.md](../../../backend/api/cardimembers.md).

**Profile Section:**
- Large photo (`MemberAvatar`, 80dp, sized to the three-line block beside it) — the member's photo when one is set (`photoUrl`, a short-lived signed URL), initials otherwise. Photos are added on M1-04 or changed on M1-14.
- Name and "78 years old • Dad" (the *requesting caregiver's* relationship, not the first link on the member)
- Connection-status dot (red / amber / blue / green — same `dataFreshness` as the dashboard) in front of last-contact age ("Updated 4 minutes ago"). The Monitoring Info card is gone; device count lives on M1-15.

**Key Metric Trends (carousel, one swipeable card per metric):**
- **Loops:** a swipe past the last metric returns to the first.
- Activity, Heart Rate, Sleep, Skin Temp, Blood Oxygen and Breathing Rate, over a caregiver-chosen **7 / 14 / 30-day** window. The API always sends 30 days of `series`, so switching windows is a client-side slice rather than another round trip.
- Each chart draws the daily line over **the two things the reading is compared against**: a dashed rule at this member's own learned `baseline`, and a shaded band at the published `reference` range for an adult of this member's age (60–100 bpm AHA, 7–9 h NSF — 7–8 from age 65, 94–100 % WHO, 12–20 brpm WHO — see [health-data.md](../../../backend/api/health-data.md)). A key under the chart names both and quotes their numbers; steps and skin temp have no published range, so they show the baseline alone.
- Both are drawn in neutral ink, never the status accent — they are context, not a verdict. The band is **presentational only**: the card's pill still reads this member against their own normal, not against the population. The one exception is the **sleep band**, which caps the sleep card's stars at both ends — a 4.5-hour night cannot be five stars however efficiently it was slept, nor can a 12-hour one, and a member whose own normal is 4.5 hours is the reason the cap cannot come off. It only ever lowers the rating; see [health-data.md](../../../backend/api/health-data.md).
- The chart's axis makes room for them, but not at any price: where admitting the band or the baseline would flatten the readings into a straight line, the readings keep the scale and the band is drawn clipped to the plot edge. The baseline rule is dropped instead — a rule pinned to the edge would read as a baseline sitting exactly there — and its key loses the dash and reads "Baseline 9,000 (off chart)". The number stays: a window that far from the member's own normal is why the rule would not fit, which makes it the thing most worth reading.
- Fewer than two readings in the window shows "Not enough readings in this window yet." instead of an empty grid.

**Contact Info (as built):**
- Emergency contact and the member's own phone are two looping carousel slides — swipe past Phone and Emergency Contact is next
- Emergency slide: name + number, call when a number exists; empty copy rather than a missing slide
- Phone slide: number, call + message when a number exists

**Medical Info Card (encrypted):**
- Lock icon in card header; collapsible notes, collapsed by default
- Notes are **encrypted at rest** (AES-256-GCM) as of this screen — rows written before that are still readable
- Biometric gating of medical notes remains **deferred to R4** (per the [release matrix](../../../../release_matrix.md)) — not an MVP 1 requirement

**Action Buttons:**
- "View Dashboard" → M1-09 · "View Alerts" → M1-10 · "Manage Device" → M1-15

**Management (danger zone):**
- "Pause Monitoring" — bounded 1 hour to 7 days, chosen from an action sheet then confirmed. The row becomes "Resume Monitoring" while paused. A pause **stops data collection**, not just the display: the sync worker skips paused members, and the dashboard hero shows a distinct `paused` status rather than a health colour.
- "Remove CardiMember" — confirmed, then soft-deletes the member, their caregiver links and their device connections, discarding stored OAuth tokens. Health history is retained.

**Permissions:** editing, pausing and removing require the caller to be a **primary caregiver**; the edit button is hidden and the management rows explain themselves for view-only caregivers.

**States (4 as built):**
- **Loading:** skeleton cards
- **Loaded:** as above
- **Error:** "We couldn't load these details" with retry
- **Paused:** amber banner naming the resume time and reason

### M1-14: Edit CardiMember
**Status:** Built (`EditCardiMemberPage`)
**User Story:** 1.4 CardiMember Profile Management
**Entry:** ← M1-13 CardiMember Detail (edit button)
**Exit:** ← M1-13 CardiMember Detail (cancel or save)

Saves via `PUT /api/v1/cardimembers/{id}` — a full replacement, so clearing a field is expressed as an empty value rather than "leave it alone".

**Header:**
- Back/cancel button, title "Edit Profile", Save button

**Form (scrollable):**

**Photo:** the member's photo when one is set, otherwise an initials avatar live-updating as the name is typed. Tapping the avatar — or the "Change Photo" link beneath — opens the photo action sheet (take / choose from library / remove); a replacement or removal is applied when the form saves (`photoBase64` / `removePhoto`, never both).

**Basic Info:** "Full Name*", "Date of Birth*" (picker), "Relationship*" (picker)

**Medical & Emergency:** "Medical Notes" (multi-line, ≤2000 chars, encrypted at rest), "Emergency Contact Name", "Emergency Contact Number"

**Monitoring Preferences:**
- ~~Toggle: "Enable Monitoring"~~ — **not shipped here.** Monitoring is paused from M1-13's Management section, where it is time-bounded; an open-ended toggle on an edit form is how someone stops being monitored without anyone deciding to.
- Dropdown: "Alert Sensitivity" — Low / Medium / High. **Stored but not consumed** — statistical alerting uses the established 30-day baseline, not this field. The in-app caption still says alerting isn't live (copy bug).

**Behavior:**
- Client-side validation mirrors the server's rules (name 2–100, age 18–120, phone format, notes ≤2000)
- Tracks unsaved changes and warns before discarding them on cancel

**States (3 as built):** loading skeleton · form · error with retry

### M1-15: Device Management
**Status:** Built (`DeviceManagementPage`)
**User Story:** 6.2 Devices
**Entry:** ← M1-13 CardiMember Detail ("Manage Device") | ← M2-01 Settings ("Connected Devices") _(MVP 2)_
**Exit:** ← Previous screen (back) | → M1-05 Device Selection ("+ Add Device")

**Header:** back button, "Connected Devices", "+ Add Device" (launches the M1-05..M1-07 wizard modally; the wizard returns here on success — it continues to M1-08 only when this member had no device yet)

**Devices List:** headed by the CardiMember's name; one card per connection.

**Device Card:**
- Provider logo, device name, status chip (`ACTIVE` / `NEEDS RECONNECT` / `DISCONNECTED`), "synced 10m ago"
- **Sharing row** — a "SHARING" caption, **one pill per dataset family**, and a chevron. Datasets are mapped from the granted OAuth scopes by `DeviceDatasets` (`CardiTrack.Mobile.Core`), then collapsed by family, so a fully-granted Fitbit reads `Activity 5` · `Heart 4` · `Sleep 2` · `Body 4` rather than fifteen pills. Pills are tinted by family (activity blue, heart rose, sleep purple, body teal, unrecognised grey) in the design's `Activity, HR, Sleep` order, Body and Other after.
  - **Pill count is bounded by the five families, not by the grant.** Every card is the same height whatever each device shares, so two devices can be compared down the column, and colour means one category rather than repeating across a block.
  - A family carrying a **single** dataset names that dataset instead — `Weight`, not `Body 1` — since the name costs the same width and says more. Families carrying several show the family name and the count.
  - **Tap the SHARING header** to expand one detail line per family — `Heart  Heart Rate · Resting HR` — which is where the individual reading names now live. The header is the only tap target: it is where the disclosure state is announced, so it has to be the element an assistive-technology activation reaches, and confining the gesture there keeps a tap on a pill or on the detail text from collapsing the panel out from under the reader. The chevron is hidden when every pill already names its one dataset. The expanded state is held by the page (`_expandedSharing`), so a pull-to-refresh or a device action does not snap it shut.
  - A connection sharing nothing shows a single **"Not sharing any data"** pill in the caution tint the `NEEDS RECONNECT` chip uses — it is a problem to fix, not a neutral fact.
  - The mapping is deliberately narrower than the scopes: it names only what `GoogleHealthApiClient` actually fetches, because a reading the client never reads is not one the member is sharing with us, whatever the consent screen allowed. HRV was the standing example of that until the 2026-08-22 sweep started fetching it — the test did not change, the client did. Scopes we don't recognise are humanised (`irregular_rhythm` → "Irregular Rhythm") rather than rendered as raw URIs — the pre-pill label printed the full `googleapis.com/auth/...` scope strings on the card — and share the grey `Other` pill.
  - SpO2, VO2 max, breathing rate and body temperature are named too, in the existing **Body** family — `GoogleHealthApiClient` ingests all four under `health_metrics_and_measurements`, which is the same test every other name passes (issue #82). Under the family row the four cost **one pill between them** (none at all where `Weight` already put `Body` on the card) instead of four — which is the point of collapsing the row: the mapping can keep growing without the card growing with it.
  - HRV joined the same bundle on 2026-08-22 and takes a **Heart**-family name (`HRV`); heart-rate zones joined `activity_and_fitness` and take `HR Zones`, also Heart. Under the family row neither adds a pill to a card that already shows Heart — which is the point of collapsing the row.
  - **Still open:** none of the readings named in the two bullets above have an **M1-09 Key Metrics card**. Each card needs a hand-authored icon and a Figma slot, and the Key Metrics section is specified as steps, heart rate and sleep — so adding cards is a design decision, not a mapping fix. Detailed per-metric history remains M2-03.
- Primary device star when designated
- ~~Menu icon (three dots)~~ — **actions are inline** rather than behind a menu, matching the Figma frame

**Permissions:** the three actions below require a **primary caregiver**; a view-only caregiver can see the list but not change it.

**Actions (inline on each card):**
- **Refresh Connection** — renews the OAuth token and reports the result. Does **not** pull health data: syncing is the Worker's job per `CLAUDE.md`. A provider that can't be reached marks the connection `token_expired` so the screen agrees with what the user was told.
- **Set as Primary** — switch; disabled on the device that already is primary, since turning it off would leave the member without one
- **Remove Device** — confirmed, then soft-deletes the connection and discards its stored tokens. If it was the primary, another active device is promoted.

**Stats row:**
- Last sync · Next sync (derived from last sync + the connection's interval) · Today's data ("4 updates")
- Battery ("72%", or the provider's band when it reports no percentage) — **shipped**, sourced from the Health API's `pairedDevices` resource. The tile and its grid column collapse whenever the server sends no reading, which is the normal case for any connection made before the `settings` scope was added, for a scale, and for a reading older than 24 hours. Four tiles when there is a battery to show, three when there is not. Red at or below 10%, the same threshold `DEVICE_BATTERY_LOW` fires at, so the tile never disagrees with a notification the caregiver has already had.
- ~~View Sync History~~ — no sync-history endpoint exists

**Troubleshooting (bottom, collapsible):** "Having trouble?" with reconnect guidance. Wording avoids Bluetooth — these are cloud OAuth connections, not paired peripherals.

**States (4 as built):** loading skeleton · device list · empty ("No devices connected yet" + connect CTA) · error with retry

### M1-16: Alert Detail - Heart Rate
**Status:** Built (`AlertDetailPage`) — `elevated_heart_rate` uses the 7-day resting-HR series; `realtime_hr` uses that hour's granular HR.
**User Story:** 11.2 Elevated HR
**Entry:** ← M1-10 Alerts List
**Exit:** ← M1-10 Alerts List (back) | → Phone call | → M2-03 Trend Charts

**Alert Header:**
- Urgent severity banner
- Lightning bolt icon
- Title: "Elevated Heart Rate Alert"
- CardiMember photo + name + timestamp

**Description:**
- "Mom's heart rate has been running higher than usual for the past 3 days"

**Chart:**
- 7-day heart rate chart
- Shaded normal range (68-75 bpm)
- Elevated portion highlighted with urgent severity treatment

**Comparison Grid:**

| Current | Normal | Difference |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| 88 bpm | 68 bpm | +29% above baseline |

**Context Card:**
- "Here's what might be going on:"
  - She could be fighting off an illness
  - She might be feeling stressed or anxious
  - She may not be drinking enough water
  - It could be a side effect of her medication

**Recommended Actions:**
1. "Suggest a Doctor Visit" (primary, urgent treatment)
2. "Keep watching for a couple more days" (secondary)
3. "Call Mom to ask how she's feeling" (secondary)

**Medical History (collapsible):**
- "Related Health Info"
- Shows medications, conditions from CardiMember profile

### M1-17: Health Data Export
**Status:** ✅ Built (`ExportHealthDataPage`). As-built notes follow the design intent below.
**User Story:** 6.3 Health Data Export
**Entry:** ← M2-03 Trend Charts (Export icon) | ← M2-01 Settings ("Export Health Data") | ← M1-13 CardiMember Detail ("Export Data")
**Exit:** ← Previous screen (back) | → Share sheet / email

**Header:**
- Back button
- Title: "Export Health Data"

**CardiMember Selector:**
- Dropdown: "Export data for: [Dad]"

**Date Range:**
- "From" date picker
- "To" date picker
- Quick presets: [Last 7 Days] [Last 30 Days] [Last 90 Days] [All Data]

**Data Selection (checkboxes):**
- Activity & Steps
- Heart Rate
- Sleep Data
- Alerts & Events
- Notes (if any)

**Export Format (radio buttons):**

| Format | Description | Use Case | Available |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| PDF Report | Human-readable summary with charts | Sharing with family or personal records | **MVP 1** |
| CSV | Raw data spreadsheet | Personal analysis | **MVP 1** |
| FHIR (R4) | Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources | Modern EHR integration, patient portals | **MVP 1** |
| HL7 v2 | Health Level Seven messaging format | Hospital system integration | MVP 2 |

**Format Info (expandable per format):**
- Tap info icon next to FHIR → explains format, typical recipients (hospitals, clinics, patient portals)

**Delivery Method:**
- "Save to Device" (default)
- "Email to..." — email input with autocomplete (self, doctor, family)
- "Share via..." — opens native share sheet

**Preview Section:**
- "Preview Export" button — shows first page / sample of export
- Estimated file size: "~2.4 MB"

**CTA:**
- Primary button: "Export Data"
- Progress: "Generating export..." with progress bar
- Success: "Export complete!" with option to share or save

**States:**
- **M1-17a — Default:** Format and date selection
- **M1-17b — Generating:** Progress bar with cancel option
- **M1-17c — Complete:** Success message with share/save actions
- **M1-17d — Error:** "That didn't work — let's try again" with retry

**As built** — four panels on one page, so an error returns the caregiver to the form they filled in rather than to the start of a flow. Differences from the intent above, each deliberate:

- **One delivery action, not three.** "Save or share" opens the native share sheet, which on both iOS and Android *is* the route to Save to Files / Save to Drive as well as to mail and messaging — a separate "Save to Device" button would open the same sheet. "Email to…" is not built: mailing PHI from the server is its own subsystem (provider, address verification, abuse limits) and is not MVP 1 scope. An **Open** action sits beside it so a PDF can be read without leaving the app.
- **No preview.** "Preview Export" is not built; the estimated file size is, computed from the period and format.
- **Plan gate before the form.** A Basic caregiver sees the Complete Care upsell instead of a form that would come back 402. The check is `GET /api/v1/reports/availability` — a courtesy for the UI; the API refuses on its own regardless.
- **Data selection is three checkboxes**, not five: activity/heart rate/sleep travel together on one daily row, and there is no notes feature to include.
- **HL7 v2 is not offered** — MVP 2, and refused by the API's validator.
- Progress is an indeterminate spinner: the API reports no percentage (`progressPercent` is always null).

**Entry points as built:** M1-13 CardiMember Detail ("Export Data", scoped to that member) and Settings → Account ("Export health data", which asks who). M2-03 Trend Charts is R2.
