## Onboarding Flow UX

### Step 1: Value Proposition (30 seconds)
- Hero image: Happy elderly person with Fitbit, smiling family on phone
- Headline: "Peace of Mind for Your Family. $8/month."
- 3 key benefits with icons:
  - Works with devices they already own (Fitbit, Apple Watch, etc.)
  - AI alerts you BEFORE health issues become emergencies
  - 70% cheaper than medical alert systems ($8 vs $47/month)
- CTA: "Start Free 30-Day Trial"

### Step 2: Account Creation (1 minute)
- Email/password or "Continue with Google/Apple"
- Checkbox: "I agree to Terms & Privacy Policy" (with links)
- Auto-login after creation

### Step 3: Add CardiMember (2 minutes)
- "Who would you like to monitor?"
- Form: Name, DOB, Relationship, Photo (optional)
- Tone: "We'll help you set up monitoring in 3 simple steps"

### Step 4: Device Connection (3 minutes)
- "What wearable device does [Name] use?"
- Device icons with brands (Fitbit active; others Coming Soon in MVP 1)
- Click → OAuth flow → Success
- "Great! We're syncing [Name]'s data. This may take a few minutes."

### Step 5: Baseline Learning (Info screen)
- "CardiTrack is learning [Name]'s normal patterns..."
- Progress indicator: "Day 3 of 30"
- "You'll start receiving alerts after we establish a baseline (30 days)"
- Option: "Use statistical alerts in the meantime" (basic threshold alerts)

### Step 6: First Dashboard View
- Celebratory tone: "You're all set! Here's [Name]'s health overview."
- Guided tour overlay (5 tooltips):
  1. "This shows overall health status"
  2. "View detailed trends here"
  3. "Alerts appear in this section"
  4. "Invite family members here"
  5. "Need help? Check our support docs"

## UI/UX Design Principles (MVP 1)

### Principle 1: Trust Through Transparency
- Show data source and reasoning for every alert
- Use warm, caring language ("Your mom's activity is lower than usual. Might be worth a check-in call")
- Avoid medical jargon and alarmist language

### Principle 2: Simplicity Over Features
- Information hierarchy: Status → Alert → Action
- Progressive disclosure (advanced features hidden until needed)
- Mobile-first design

### Principle 3: Peace of Mind, Not Panic
- Green status should be prominent when all is well
- Alerts provide context, not just warnings
- Success messaging ("Your dad had his most active week this month!")

### Principle 4: Respect for Elderly Dignity
- Never use patronizing language or imagery
- Focus on independence and wellness, not decline
- Consent-first approach to all monitoring

### Principle 5: Multi-Generational Accessibility
- WCAG AA compliance minimum (AAA preferred)
- Font size options (small/medium/large)
- High contrast mode
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimization
