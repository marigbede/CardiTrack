## Design System (Designer Deliverable)

The design system is **yours to define**. The following are functional requirements and constraints — not visual prescriptions.

### What You Need to Define
- Color palette (brand colors, semantic colors, status colors)
- Typography scale (font family, sizes, weights)
- Spacing and layout grid
- Component library (buttons, cards, inputs, tables, badges, modals, etc.)
- Iconography style
- Motion and animation language
- Dark mode (if applicable)

### Functional Requirements

**4 severity levels must be visually distinct from each other:**

| Level | Meaning | Must Convey |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Normal | Everything is fine | Calm, reassuring |
| Caution | Something to be aware of | Mild concern, not urgent |
| Urgent | Action recommended soon | Clear importance, time-sensitive |
| Critical | Immediate action needed | Emergency, cannot be missed |

**Visual hierarchy needs:**
- Primary actions must be clearly distinguishable from secondary and tertiary actions
- Destructive actions (delete, remove) must be visually distinct from standard actions
- Unread/new states must be clearly differentiated from read/acknowledged states
- Data comparison (current vs. baseline) needs clear visual treatment
- Hover states must be defined for all interactive elements
- Focus states must be visible for keyboard navigation

### Constraints

**Accessibility (non-negotiable):**
- WCAG AA minimum contrast (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text)
- Status must never rely on color alone — always pair with icon, text, or pattern
- All interactive elements must be keyboard-accessible (Tab, Enter, Space, Escape)
- Focus indicators must be clearly visible
- All form inputs must have programmatically associated labels
- All images must have descriptive alt text

**Platform:**
- Desktop-first layout — sidebar + content area as primary pattern
- Responsive down to 375px mobile width
- Blazor components must support SSR + interactivity (Server render mode)
- SignalR connection state must be visually represented (connected / reconnecting / offline)

**User context:**
- Primary users are 30–65 year old adults; critical alerts may be read in high-stress moments — design for quick scanning
- The app will be used at a desk or laptop as primary context; occasional mobile browser use
- Keyboard navigation should be first-class (power caregivers check-in frequently)

## Asset Inventory

Icons use **Heroicons** or **Lucide** (open source, MIT license) — no custom icon design needed. Third-party logos (Google, Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Samsung, Withings, Visa) are sourced from vendor brand kits. Items below are assets that need to be created or sourced.

### MVP 1 — Assets

#### Illustrations (Storyset / Blush or custom)

| # | Asset | Screen | Description |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Hero illustration | W1-01 | Elderly person with smartwatch + family member at laptop — warm, reassuring tone |
| 2 | "How It Works" step icons | W1-01 | 3 icons: Connect device / Monitor patterns / Get alerted |
| 3 | Onboarding person silhouette | W1-03 | Placeholder for CardiMember photo — neutral, warm |
| 4 | Learning Phase | W1-07 | Brain with gears concept — "getting to know your loved one." Can be Lottie or static |
| 5 | Empty Alerts | W1-09 | Muted bell or peaceful scene — "nothing to worry about" feeling |
| 6 | No Device Connected | W1-08 | Prompt to connect a device — friendly nudge, not an error |

**Style guidance:** All 6 illustrations must share the same art style and brand color palette. Choose one Storyset or Blush collection and customize colors. Tone: warm, caring, approachable — not clinical.

#### Brand Assets (custom — must be unique)

| # | Asset | Used On | Notes |
|---|-------|---------|-------|
| 1 | CardiTrack logo | W1-01 (header + footer), W1-02, W1-05, W1-07 | SVG master. Export: full-colour, monochrome, favicon (16, 32, 180px). |
| 2 | Favicon / PWA icon | Browser tab, PWA install, W4-01 | 512×512 + all required sizes. Must look distinct at 16×16. |

#### Animations

| # | Animation | Screen | Source |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Success checkmark | W1-06 | LottieFiles — "success checkmark" (free options available) |
| 2 | Skeleton / shimmer loading | W1-08, W1-09, W2-03 | CSS animation — reusable across all cards and tables |
| 3 | Critical alert pulse | W1-11 | CSS animation — opacity + border-color loop on severity banner |
| 4 | Learning phase brain/gears | W1-07 | LottieFiles — "machine learning" or "brain processing." Or use static illustration + CSS spinner |

#### Animations

| # | Animation | Screen | Source |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| 5 | OCR processing steps | W3-06 | Step indicator animation (3 steps). CSS or LottieFiles — "document scanning" |

#### Icons (open source — no custom design)

All icons in MVP 3 reuse Heroicons / Lucide. No new custom icons needed.

---

### MVP 4 — Assets

#### Icons (open source — no custom design)

| # | Icon | Screen | Source |
|---|------|--------|--------|

## Figma Delivery Requirements

This project uses **Cursor + Figma MCP** to build the UI directly from Figma designs. The following requirements ensure the designs translate accurately into Blazor components.

### File Structure

- Organise screens into **named Pages** per MVP: `MVP 1 — Core Monitoring`, `MVP 2 — Management & Settings`, `MVP 3 — Family & Multi-Member`, `MVP 4 — Web Native & Offline`
- Each screen must live in its own **named Frame**, using the Screen IDs from this document (e.g. `W1-08 Main Dashboard`)
- For each screen, provide **3 frames**: Desktop (1440px), Tablet (768px), Mobile (375px)
- Group all reusable UI into a dedicated **`Components`** page

### Layout

- Use **Auto Layout** on every frame, section, and component — this is critical for accurate Blazor code generation
- Set explicit **spacing tokens** via Auto Layout gap/padding values (do not use manual nudging)
- Define a consistent **8pt grid** for all spacing and sizing
- Mark responsive breakpoint behavior using Figma's **constraints** and **min/max width** properties

### Design Tokens (Figma Variables)

Set up the following as **Figma Variables** (not hardcoded values):

| Token Type | Examples |
|------------|---------|
| Colors | `color/status/normal`, `color/status/caution`, `color/status/urgent`, `color/status/critical`, `color/brand/primary`, `color/text/primary`, `color/background/card`, `color/background/sidebar` |
| Typography | `text/heading/large`, `text/heading/page`, `text/body/default`, `text/label/small`, `text/label/badge` |
| Spacing | `space/xs` (4), `space/sm` (8), `space/md` (16), `space/lg` (24), `space/xl` (32) |
| Radius | `radius/card`, `radius/button`, `radius/chip`, `radius/modal` |
| Shadow | `shadow/card`, `shadow/modal`, `shadow/dropdown` |

### Components

- Publish all reusable UI as **Figma Components** with variants (e.g. Button: Primary / Secondary / Destructive / Disabled)
- Name components using the pattern: `ComponentName/Variant` (e.g. `AlertRow/Critical`, `Button/Primary`)
- Use **component properties** (text, boolean, instance swap) so variants are machine-readable
- All interactive states must be defined as variants: Default, Hover, Focus, Active, Disabled, Loading, Error
- Define **table rows** as components with hover state (required for alert list and device table)

### Naming Conventions

- All layers must be **named meaningfully** — no `Frame 42`, `Rectangle 7`, or `Group 3`
- Use camelCase or kebab-case consistently (e.g. `statusHeroCard` or `status-hero-card`)
- Hidden layers that are not part of the design must be deleted, not just hidden

### Handoff Checklist (per screen)

Before marking a screen as ready:
- [ ] Screen is in a named frame with the correct Screen ID
- [ ] 3 breakpoint frames provided: Desktop (1440px), Tablet (768px), Mobile (375px)
- [ ] All layers are named
- [ ] Auto Layout is applied throughout
- [ ] All colors and text styles reference Figma Variables (no hardcoded hex values)
- [ ] All interactive states (hover, focus, loading, error) are defined as variants
- [ ] Responsive behavior is annotated (which columns collapse, what reflows to single column)
- [ ] All four severity levels (Normal / Caution / Urgent / Critical) are visually tested in context
- [ ] Keyboard focus states are defined on all interactive elements

### Figma Access

- Share the file with **Edit access** so the MCP server can read all component and variable data
- Provide a **personal access token** (Figma → Settings → Security → Personal Access Tokens) for MCP authentication
- Alternatively, use **OAuth login** if using the official Figma remote MCP server

### MCP Configuration (Cursor)

The developer will connect Cursor to Figma using the following MCP config (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-developer-mcp", "--figma-api-key", "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once connected, screen designs can be referenced directly by Figma frame URL during development — no manual redlines or spec exports needed.
