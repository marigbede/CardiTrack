# CardiTrack Web App — User Stories

Based on the web screen specifications, solution manifest, and market analysis, here are comprehensive user stories for the CardiTrack Blazor web application, organised by persona and MVP.

---

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Primary Persona: Family Caregiver (Ages 45-65)

The primary web user checks in from a laptop or desktop at home or work. They want quick, at-a-glance status checks and the ability to dig into detail when something looks off. Speed and clarity matter — they are typically busy adults fitting monitoring into their daily routine.

## 🎨 Web UI/UX Design Principles

### Principle 1: Desktop-First, Mobile-Ready
**Context:** Primary web users check in from a laptop during the workday
- Sidebar + top bar navigation optimised for large screens
- Responsive breakpoints (1024px / 768px / 375px) ensure mobile web is usable
- 2-column split layouts (list + detail) make efficient use of screen space on desktop
- Single-column stacked layouts on mobile — no horizontal scrolling

### Principle 2: Speed Above All
**Context:** Caregivers open the tab briefly during a busy day — every extra click is a barrier
- Dashboard is the default landing page after login — no intermediate screens
- Most common actions (acknowledge, call, view detail) available with one click or one keyboard shortcut
- Command palette (`⌘K`) enables instant navigation to any page
- SignalR eliminates the need to manually refresh

### Principle 3: Trust Through Clarity
**Context:** Health data is sensitive — users need to feel in control
- Data provenance shown on every metric (which device, when synced)
- Plain language on all alerts — no medical jargon, no ambiguous numbers without context
- Acknowledge + note flow creates a shared audit trail that builds family trust
- Privacy messaging on any encrypted or sensitive field

### Principle 4: Calm When Calm, Urgent When Urgent
**Context:** 80% of sessions should feel reassuring; 20% require immediate action
- Green / Normal state is visually dominant — makes calm status unmissable
- Critical states use animation (pulsing border) to demand attention appropriately
- Caution and Urgent states are clearly differentiated from each other
- Alerts provide context and suggested actions — not just warnings

### Principle 5: Accessibility Is Non-Negotiable
**Context:** Users range from 30–85 years old; some sessions under stress
- WCAG AA minimum contrast (4.5:1 text, 3:1 large text)
- Full keyboard navigation across every page
- Focus indicators clearly visible — never hidden or too subtle
- Status never conveyed by colour alone — always paired with icon and text
- Screen reader labels on all interactive elements and data visualisations
