# CardiTrack Worker Service

## Overview

`CardiTrack.Worker` hosts the platform's **non-AI scheduled background jobs**, driven by cron expressions and the [Cronos](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Cronos) library. Although it is a background service, the project uses the **`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` SDK with `Exe` output** — Cloud Run requires an HTTP listener for startup probes, so the worker binds Kestrel to the `PORT` env var (default 8080) and exposes a minimal `GET /healthz` endpoint alongside its hosted services.

The 16 workers registered today (crons from `appsettings.json`):

| Worker | Default cron (UTC) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WearableSyncWorker` | `0 */10 * * * *` (every 10 min) | Polls due device connections and syncs wearable data |
| `OrphanedOrganizationCleanupWorker` | `0 0 3 * * *` (daily 03:00) | Deletes organizations stranded by a failed onboarding |
| `OrphanedPhotoCleanupWorker` | `0 30 3 * * *` (daily 03:30) | Deletes member-photo blobs no active member references (24 h grace) and clears photos left on soft-deleted members — the enforcement backstop behind the API's best-effort deletes |
| `BaselineCalculationWorker` | `0 30 2 * * *` (daily 02:30) | Recalculates each member's `PatternBaseline` rows — 7/14-day provisional and 30/60/90-day windows |
| `PartitionMaintenanceWorker` | `0 15 * * * *` (hourly; `RunOnStartup: true`) | Pre-creates partitions for the partitioned time-series tables and drops the ones past retention — granular 90 d, hourly rollups 13 mo, **digests 7 mo, real-time assessments 90 d, environmental readings 90 d** |
| `DeviceSyncAuditWorker` | `0 0 4 * * 0` (Sunday 04:00) | Re-fetches a small random sample over a 14-day window to measure how far back each provider revises data |
| `InactivityDetectionWorker` | `0 */15 * * * *` (every 15 min) | Device-silence failsafe — one yellow `Inactivity` alert when a member has no granular readings for >2 h in waking hours |
| `StatisticalAlertWorker` | `0 7-59/15 * * * *` (every 15 min, offset) | R1 statistical alert engine — nine deterministic rules vs the established 30-day baseline |
| `MetricAlarmWorker` | `0 4-59/5 * * * *` (every 5 min, offset) | Caregiver-defined alarms — threshold arithmetic on numbers a caregiver set themselves |
| `QuestionnaireExpiryWorker` | `0 12-59/20 * * * *` (every 20 min, offset) | Retires family questions that outlived the day they asked about |
| `QuestionnaireAlertWorker` | `0 */5 * * * *` (every 5 min) | Raises the alert that carries a pending family question to the caregiver |
| `QuietReassuranceWorker` | `0 30 8 * * *` (daily 08:30) | The reassurance pass — telling a family that a long quiet stretch is genuinely quiet |
| `DeviceAuthRecoveryWorker` | `0 3-59/15 * * * *` (every 15 min, offset) | Retries provider-refused refresh tokens on a per-connection widening backoff |
| `DataCompletenessWorker` | `0 0 6 * * *` (daily 06:00) | Reconciles data-completeness nudges per caregiver against what each account supplies |
| `NotificationDispatchWorker` | `*/30 * * * * *` (every 30 s) | The push spine's pump — claims due outbox rows, retries, escalates, expires |
| `PushCanaryWorker` | `0 */15 * * * *` (every 15 min) | Sends a real Safety push to configured test devices and screams if the previous one never acked |

OAuth token refresh is **not a separate cron job** — it happens inside the sync path (`DeviceSyncService` calls `IOAuthTokenRefreshService` before hitting the provider API), with `DeviceAuthRecoveryWorker` retrying only the connections the provider has refused. Trial expiration reminders and the general data-retention job are **planned** but not yet implemented; the partitioned tables' retention is the exception, live via `PartitionMaintenanceWorker` — it covers the granular tables **and** `DigestEntries` (7 months), `RealtimeAssessments` (90 days) and `EnvironmentalReadings` (90 days).

> **Scope note:** the AI ingestion/inference pipeline (webhook aggregation, pre-processing, MedGemma calls, severity routing, digests) is **live in dev** — Pub/Sub + dedicated Cloud Run services per [llm_design.md](../../llm_design.md) (prod gated off). The `WearableSyncWorker` polling job below is the **guaranteed fallback** and runs in every environment; the registered webhook path triggers the same sync sooner, never a duplicate (see [release_matrix.md](../../release_matrix.md)).

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 10**: Core framework (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`, `OutputType=Exe`)
- **Cronos 0.13.0**: Cron expression parsing (HangfireIO)
- **BackgroundService**: Built-in .NET hosted service base class
- **Keyed DI** (.NET 10): Per-provider sync service dispatch
- **Entity Framework Core (Npgsql)**: PostgreSQL data access; `Npgsql.EnableLegacyTimestampBehavior` is disabled so all `timestamptz` values surface as UTC
- **Serilog / `ILogger`**: Structured logging (console + APM shipping via `CardiTrack.Observability`)

## Core Components

### CronBackgroundService

Abstract base class that drives any scheduled job via a cron expression. A logger is **required** — both the optional run-on-startup invocation and every scheduled tick swallow job exceptions so one failing worker cannot take down the host (`BackgroundServiceExceptionBehavior.StopHost` is the default). A job that throws misses its own tick and is logged; it runs again on the next occurrence.

```csharp
public abstract class CronBackgroundService : BackgroundService
{
    private readonly CronExpression _cron;
    private readonly TimeZoneInfo _timeZone;
    private readonly bool _runOnStartup;
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    protected CronBackgroundService(
        string cronExpression,
        ILogger logger,
        TimeZoneInfo? timeZone = null,
        bool runOnStartup = false)
    {
        _cron = CronExpression.Parse(cronExpression, CronFormat.IncludeSeconds);
        _timeZone = timeZone ?? TimeZoneInfo.Utc;
        _runOnStartup = runOnStartup;
        _logger = logger ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(logger));
    }

    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        if (_runOnStartup && !stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            try { await ExecuteJobAsync(stoppingToken); }
            catch (Exception ex) when (ex is not OperationCanceledException)
            {
                _logger.LogError(ex, "Run-on-startup invocation of {Job} failed.", GetType().Name);
            }
        }

        while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            var now = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow;
            var next = _cron.GetNextOccurrence(now, _timeZone);
            if (next is null) break;

            var delay = next.Value - now;
            if (delay > TimeSpan.Zero)
                await Task.Delay(delay, stoppingToken);

            if (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                try { await ExecuteJobAsync(stoppingToken); }
                catch (Exception ex) when (ex is not OperationCanceledException)
                {
                    _logger.LogError(ex, "Scheduled invocation of {Job} failed.", GetType().Name);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    protected abstract Task ExecuteJobAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken);
}
```

### WearableSyncWorker

Reads its cron schedule from the named `WorkerOptions` (see [Configuration](#configuration)), creates a DI scope per run, and dispatches to the keyed `IDeviceSyncService` for each due device connection.

**Due** means the connection's own `SyncFrequencyMinutes` has elapsed since its `LastSyncDate` — the interval is per connection, not a fixed threshold, so the cron schedule sets only how often the worker *looks*. Every due connection syncs, including several belonging to the same CardiMember.

`GetDueForSyncAsync` also excludes connections whose CardiMember has been removed or has monitoring paused. That filter lives in the query rather than the worker so every caller inherits it — pausing monitoring has to actually stop collection, not merely change what the app displays.

### Two-tier health data

Wearable data lands in two tables:

| Table | Grain | Written by |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `DeviceActivityLogs` | one row per **device** per day — unique on `(DeviceConnectionId, Date)` | `DeviceSyncService`, straight from the provider |
| `ActivityLogs` | one row per **CardiMember** per day — unique on `(CardiMemberId, Date)` | `ActivityLogAggregationService`, derived from the raw rows |

Every reader (`DashboardService`, `HealthInsightService`, `ReportGenerationService`, the chat endpoint) consumes `ActivityLogs` only, so a member wearing two devices still presents as one clean daily series.

The merge (`ActivityLogMerge`) resolves **each metric independently**: the first device, in priority order, that reported a non-null value wins. Values are **never summed** — a watch and a ring worn by the same person both count the same steps, so adding them would double-count. Coalescing instead lets devices fill each other's gaps, which is the real benefit of wearing more than one: the ring supplies sleep and SpO2, the watch supplies steps and heart rate.

Priority is `IsPrimary` desc → `ConnectedDate` asc → `Id`, the same ordering everywhere. A raw row whose connection has since been removed is kept and simply sorted last, so deleting a device never silently drops history.

Because the merge always rebuilds from the full raw set for that member-day, it is idempotent and order-independent — re-running it, or running it after any device's row changes, converges on the same result. A provider that later revises a day is picked up on the next sync.

> **Providers must report a missing metric as `null`, never `0`.** The merge coalesces on the first non-null value, so a placeholder `0` from a higher-priority device would beat another device's genuine reading.

### What `UpdatedDate` means on a raw row

`DeviceActivityLogs.UpdatedDate` records **when the provider's numbers last changed**, not when the row was last written. `UpsertAsync` assigns the fields on the already-tracked entity and stops there — it deliberately does not call `_dbSet.Update()`, which would mark the whole entity `Modified` and make `CardiTrackDbContext.UpdateTimestamps` stamp the column on every sync.

The distinction matters because the trailing window means most upserts legitimately carry values the row already holds. If those stamped `UpdatedDate`, the column would only ever describe our own polling schedule, and two things that read it would be measuring the wrong thing:

| Derived from `UpdatedDate` | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| **Settle latency** | How long after a day ends does this provider stop revising it? — sets how soon a pull is worth making |
| **Revision tail** | How far back does it still amend? — sets how wide the trailing window has to be |
| **Poll yield** | What fraction of pulls find anything new? — once webhook ingestion lands, this doubles as the webhook miss rate |

A side effect worth having: an unchanged day no longer issues an `UPDATE` at all, so a routine sync of a settled window is now read-only.

```csharp
public class WearableSyncWorker : CronBackgroundService
{
    public WearableSyncWorker(
        IOptionsMonitor<WorkerOptions> options,
        IServiceScopeFactory scopeFactory,
        ILogger<WearableSyncWorker> logger)
        : base(options.Get(nameof(WearableSyncWorker)).CronExpression)
    { ... }

    protected override async Task ExecuteJobAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        using var scope = _scopeFactory.CreateScope();
        var deviceConnections = scope.ServiceProvider
            .GetRequiredService<IDeviceConnectionRepository>();

        // Due per each connection's own SyncFrequencyMinutes
        var connections = await deviceConnections.GetDueForSyncAsync();

        foreach (var connection in connections)
        {
            // Keyed by DeviceType — returns null for unregistered providers
            var syncService = scope.ServiceProvider
                .GetKeyedService<IDeviceSyncService>(connection.DeviceType);

            if (syncService is null)
            {
                _logger.LogWarning("No sync service for {DeviceType}. Skipping.", connection.DeviceType);
                continue;
            }

            await syncService.SyncCardiMemberAsync(connection, SyncScope.WorkerCadence);
        }
    }
}
```

Each sync goes through `DeviceSyncService`, which first refreshes the connection's OAuth token via `OAuthTokenRefreshService` when needed — token refresh is part of the sync path, not a standalone job.

It then fetches **today** — so the dashboard's Key Metrics move during the day rather than sitting on a completed day until midnight — and, on the first pull of each UTC day, a **trailing window** reaching back `DeviceProviders:<provider>:SyncLookbackDays` (default **3**) complete days, which is what covers providers finalising a day only after midnight. Splitting the two is what makes a 10-minute cadence affordable: a day's snapshot costs 18 Google Health requests against a ceiling of 300 per minute **per wearer**, so paying for four days on every pull would spend the budget re-reading finished days. Days are fetched oldest first; each is written to `DeviceActivityLogs` and saved, then that member-day is re-merged into `ActivityLogs`. The raw row is saved before the merge runs because the merge reads every device's *stored* row for the day. A provider failure part-way through still leaves the earlier days stored; `LastSyncDate` is stamped only once the whole window lands, which keeps a partially-synced connection due for retry instead of silently leaving a hole.

After a successful routine window, the Worker's pulls also **backfill history**: `DeviceConnection.HistoryBackfilledTo` walks backwards from the routine window towards `DeviceProviders:<provider>:BackfillDays` (default **90**) days ago, `BackfillChunkDays` (default **7**) days per pull, newest first. A freshly connected wearable's existing history therefore reaches the 30-day baseline within a couple of hours instead of the baseline waiting a month for new days. The chunking is what keeps this inside the per-wearer request ceiling — a 90-day one-shot would rate-limit partway and start over on the next pull. The frontier advances per day fetched, so an interrupted chunk resumes rather than refetching; days the provider has nothing for are checked but not stored, because an all-null row would count as a "data day" to the baseline coverage gate. Only the Worker opts into this (`SyncScope.WorkerCadence`) — the API's manual sync shares `SyncCardiMemberAsync` at `SyncScope.Routine`, and a caregiver waiting on a refresh must not pay for a chunk of last month.

After the routine window has landed and been marked successful, the worker cadence also fetches each window day's **granular series** — heart rate and SpO2 as timestamped samples, steps and active-zone minutes as intervals, 4 extra requests per day (worker-cadence day cost: **17**). Granular runs outside the success envelope on purpose: it is enrichment, and a transient failure in it must not un-succeed the daily data a caregiver depends on. `GranularDayBucketer` turns them into per-device hour vectors (additive metrics sum within a minute; level metrics take the latest reading), and `GranularIngestionService` stores them and recomputes the member's hourly rollups from the **merged** window — the daily pipeline's raw-then-derived shape, at hour grain. Backfill days stay daily-grain until the intraday-history probe answers how far back the provider serves minute data.

### OrphanedOrganizationCleanupWorker

Safety net behind the API's atomic `POST /api/Onboarding/setup` endpoint. The legacy two-call onboarding flow (`POST organization` then `POST user`) can strand an organization if the client dies between calls; this worker sweeps them up.

- Runs daily at 03:00 UTC (`0 0 3 * * *` by default).
- Calls `IOrganizationRepository.DeleteOrphanedAsync(MinAge)` with **`MinAge = 24 hours`** — far longer than any onboarding gap, so an in-flight signup is never swept.
- An organization is *orphaned* when it has **no users and no CardiMembers**; its trial subscription is removed with it via the `Subscription → Organization` FK cascade.
- When anything is removed it logs at **Warning**, deliberately: orphans mean some client bypassed the atomic setup endpoint and failed mid-onboarding — worth investigating, not just cleaning. A no-op run logs at Information.

### OrphanedPhotoCleanupWorker

The enforcement backstop behind the member-photo blob deletes in `CardiMemberService` (photo replace/removal and member soft delete all delete the old blob best-effort, after the save lands). A full-face photo is Tier 1 data, and "the blob must not outlive the membership" ([data_protection_architecture.md](../../technical/data_protection_architecture.md) §5) holds only if something checks — this checks.

- Runs daily at 03:30 UTC (`0 30 3 * * *` by default), offset from the organization cleanup.
- Takes a **non-blocking Postgres advisory lock** (like `DataCompletenessWorker`): a second Cloud Run instance skips the run rather than sweeping the bucket again.
- Diffs the bucket listing (`IProfilePhotoStorage.ListAsync`) against the set of active members' `PhotoObjectName` values; an object referenced by no active member **and older than 24 hours** is deleted. The grace window protects the upload-then-save crash window; since every upload gets a fresh GUID name, an unreferenced object past it can never become referenced again.
- Also clears **soft-deleted members still carrying a `PhotoObjectName`** — normally none exist (the removal path clears the column before saving), so each hit logs at **Warning**: blob deleted, column nulled, worth investigating.
- **`DryRun`** (`Workers:OrphanedPhotoCleanupWorker:DryRun`, default `false`) logs every would-be delete and touches nothing — blob and database alike.
- Per-object error boundary: a failed delete is logged (object name only — never a signed URL) and the sweep continues; the summary line reports scanned/orphaned/deleted/failed counts.
- An unset `Storage:MemberPhotos:Bucket` (every local machine) lists nothing, so the sweep is a quiet no-op.

### BaselineCalculationWorker

Turns accumulated `ActivityLog` history into `PatternBaseline` rows — the statistical picture of "a normal day" that `DashboardService` colours today's metrics against, and the thing that ends a member's *"getting to know you"* phase (`DashboardService` treats a member with no baseline at all as still learning; a 7/14-day window serves as a **provisional** baseline until the 30-day one exists, and provisional baselines never fire alerts).

- Runs daily at 02:30 UTC (`0 30 2 * * *` by default). The coverage gate in `BaselineCalculator` decides when a member has been observed for long enough; the daily cadence means the first baseline lands the morning after eligibility rather than up to a week later.
- Selects **active members with at least one activity log in the last 90 days** (`ICardiMemberRepository.GetActiveIdsWithActivitySinceAsync`), so dormant records are not rescanned on every run.
- Windows to the **last complete day**, not today. Ingestion stores the day in progress so the dashboard can show live numbers, and a part-finished day averaged in would drag every member's "normal" down by however far through the day the job happened to run.
- Fetches each member's logs **once** for the longest period and calculates every supported window (7/14 provisional, 30/60/90) from that one read.
- Uses **one DI scope per member**: the read tracks up to 90 rows each, which would accumulate across the whole run on a shared `DbContext`, and a member that fails takes nothing else down with it.
- **Appends** rather than replacing, so a shift in a member's own normal stays visible in history. Unlike the partitioned tables, **baselines have no retention today** — pruning falls under the planned retention job (see [dpia.md](../../compliance/dpia.md) §6.3).

The arithmetic lives in `BaselineCalculator` (`CardiTrack.Application/Services`) — pure and stateless, so it is unit-tested without a database or a clock. Mean and sample σ stay here (package-free Application) so a Math.NET bump cannot retune live R1 thresholds. Median and unscaled MAD are filled through `IDescriptiveStatistics` (Math.NET, registered on this host via `AddNumerics`) and **persisted on the same row**; they do not fire alerts. See [mathnet_numerics.md](../../technical/mathnet_numerics.md). Its rules:

| Rule | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Coverage gate | No baseline for a window unless **80% of it** has data (24 of 30 days; 6 of 7 for the shortest provisional window). Below that the window is skipped rather than scored against an average of almost nothing. |
| Per-metric floor | Each metric needs **7 samples** of its own (scaled down to the window's coverage bar for windows shorter than 9 days); ingestion populates metrics unevenly, so a thin metric is left null instead of averaged. |
| Spread | **Sample** standard deviation (n−1) — the dashboard turns σ into the member's normal range, so the population form would narrow that band on every member. **Median + unscaled MAD** are written alongside and unused for paging. |
| Bedtime / wake time | **Circular** mean over the 24-hour clock; an arithmetic mean of 23:40 and 00:20 is midday. Reported in **UTC** — `CardiMember` carries no timezone. |
| Weekday profile | Monday-first JSON array of average steps. A weekday with fewer than 2 samples is `null`, not `0` — "no data for Sundays" must not read as "this member does not move on Sundays". |

### PartitionMaintenanceWorker

Keeps the partitioned time-series tables (`GranularMetricHours`, `MetricRollupsHourly`, `DigestEntries`, `RealtimeAssessments`, `EnvironmentalReadings` — see the [granular-storage ADR](../../technical/granular_timeseries_storage.md)) alive: PostgreSQL neither creates range partitions on demand nor expires rows, so this job pre-creates partitions ahead of the data and drops the ones wholly past retention.

- Runs **hourly** (`0 15 * * * *`) and additionally **once at startup** — `CronBackgroundService` now supports a `RunOnStartup` mode (`WorkerOptions.RunOnStartup`, off by default) and this worker opts in (`RunOnStartup: true` in appsettings), so a fresh deploy has its partitions before the first insert rather than waiting for the next hourly tick. Creation is idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`) and near-free.
- Pre-creates from **yesterday** through `DaysAhead` days out — C# fallback is **7**; `appsettings.json` sets **14**, so a week of headroom survives a multi-day worker outage, and a sync straddling UTC midnight can still write into the day that just ended.
- Retention is a **partition drop** — instant, no dead tuples to vacuum: granular hours after `GranularRetentionDays` (default **90**), hourly rollups after `RollupRetentionMonths` (default **13**), digests after `DigestRetentionMonths` (default **7** — the longest history window any plan sells, plus margin), real-time assessments after `RealtimeRetentionDays` (default **90**), environmental readings after `EnvironmentalRetentionDays` (C# default **90**; not set in `appsettings.json`). A partition is dropped only when its whole range is past the cutoff.
- **Never drops what it did not name**: the drop path parses each child's name against the worker's own naming scheme, so a manually attached partition is left alone regardless of age.
- Drops log at **Warning** — destroying health data past retention is the one thing this job does that an audit should be able to reconstruct.

### InactivityDetectionWorker

The device-silence failsafe (llm_design's `InactivityDetector` — placed here and not in the AI pipeline because it makes no AI call, and non-AI background jobs are Worker-exclusive per CLAUDE.md). Every generated artifact deliberately refuses to speak from silence — the digest skips, the assessor skips — so a dead watch battery would otherwise produce *nothing*; this worker turns that nothing into exactly one yellow `Inactivity` alert.

- Runs **every 15 minutes** (`0 */15 * * * *`).
- **Silence means no granular readings**, deliberately not "no successful sync" — a sync that completes and returns no new minutes is precisely the dead-battery / watch-on-the-nightstand case this alert exists to catch.
- Only counts during **waking hours on the member's anchor clock** (07:00–22:00 local via the shared `MemberAnchorTimeZone` resolution, same anchor as the digest). The whole silent window must fit inside waking hours, so alerting effectively starts at `wakingStart + threshold` (09:00 on the defaults) — a watch still on its charger never trips the first alert of the day.
- Candidates are members with data in the last two days (the same filter as digest/assessment): longer-silent members have aged out *and* already carry their standing alert.
- **Cooldown**: one unresolved `Inactivity` alert per member; resolving it re-arms the check. Config (`Workers:InactivityDetectionWorker`): `SilenceThresholdMinutes` (default **120**), `WakingStartHour` (**7**), `WakingEndHour` (**22**); invalid values skip the run loudly rather than misfire.

### StatisticalAlertWorker

The R1 statistical alert engine: nine deterministic rules (`docs/execution/backend/api/alerts.md` taxonomy — activity decline, irregular sleep, elevated resting HR, no morning activity, long-term trend, and from 2026-08-22 HRV drop, overnight breathing up, elevated zone without movement, long daytime rest) evaluated against each member's **established 30-day baseline** — fetching only that baseline is how "provisional baselines never alert" is enforced. Pure rules in `StatisticalAlertRules` (Application, I/O-free, boundary-tested); orchestration in `StatisticalAlertService`.

- Runs **every 15 minutes**, offset from the inactivity worker (`0 7-59/15 * * * *`) — the cadence exists for the one intraday rule (`no_morning_activity`, red: measured-zero steps past typical wake + 2 h while the device reports); daily-grain rules are held to once per local day by the same-day dedup.
- Thresholds are the hard-coded **medium** sensitivity profile (>30% deviation; HR margin max(2σ, 5 bpm); trend ≥5%/week × 4 weeks; HRV max(2σ, 15% of mean) on two consecutive nights; overnight breathing max(2σ, 1/min); raised-zone minutes max(their usual, 25) on a day the decline rule already calls quiet; unbroken still stretch max(3 h, usual + 50%)). Low/high profiles wait on wiring `CardiMember.AlertSensitivity`. Per-rule on/off is gated by `AlertPreference` (default on).
- **Null-vs-zero discipline holds**: a null reading (not measured) never fires anything — most critically in `no_morning_activity`, where an HR-only device's absent steps field must never page a family red.
- **Cooldowns follow the family's remedy** (`AlertRuleMarkers`): rule-scoped everywhere except `HeartRate`, which is type-scoped across this engine and the AI assessor.

### MetricAlarmWorker

The caregiver-defined alarm engine (R2). Where `StatisticalAlertWorker` runs CardiTrack's own nine rules, this one runs thresholds a caregiver set themselves — metric, statistic, comparison, threshold, window, M-of-N datapoints, missing-data treatment and severity, in the grammar cloud monitoring made standard. Pure evaluation in `MetricAlarmEvaluator` and `MetricAlarmWindowing` (Application, I/O-free, boundary-tested); orchestration in `MetricAlarmEngine`. Non-AI polling, so the Worker per CLAUDE.md.

- Runs **every 5 minutes**, offset from both quarter-hour jobs (`0 4-59/5 * * * *`). Five rather than fifteen because the shortest period the catalogue offers is five minutes, and a cadence slower than the period would quietly make a "tell me within five minutes" alarm mean something else. Deliberately no faster: ingestion polls every ten, so a tighter loop would only re-read the same data.
- **Two reads per member, not two per alarm.** Every sub-daily alarm the member has is served from one minute-series fetch sized to the longest of them, and every daily alarm from one activity-log fetch. A member with eight alarms costs the same queries as a member with one. The outer filter is organizations with at least one enabled alarm, and the member query is scoped to those organizations, so a fleet where nobody has defined one costs a single query per pass and a fleet where one organization has costs that organization's members only. State rows are written on a transition and otherwise re-stamped hourly, not every tick.
- **An alert is written on the transition into alarm, never on the state.** `MetricAlarmState` carries that across ticks; a condition that stays true keeps the alarm standing and stays quiet, and only a return to normal re-arms it — a dip through `InsufficientData` mid-episode does not, so a watch taken off for a quarter of an hour does not produce a second page when it goes back on. That is deliberately *not* the alert lifecycle — a caregiver acknowledging a card says they have read it, not that the reading has come down. This is also why the worker needs no cooldown of its own, and why its alerts are kept **out of** the type-scoped `HeartRate` cooldown the assessor and the statistical engine share: an alert nobody resolves would otherwise latch both of them shut.
- **One member's failure costs that member the tick, nothing more.** The pass runs on one scope, and the change tracker is cleared after every member whichever way their turn ended — so a failed save is not replayed into every later save, and skipped members do not pile up in it.
- **The window ends at the last reading, not at the clock.** Anchoring the newest datapoint to wall-clock time would leave it permanently missing behind a ten-minute poll, making every short alarm with M equal to N unfireable. The anchor search is bounded (one hour for sub-daily, two days for daily), so a watch that has been in a drawer for a week does not have last Tuesday evaluated as if it were now. Daily readings that **accumulate through the day** — steps, raised heart-rate minutes, the longest still stretch — anchor on the last completed day rather than today's partial row, which is the same day the built-in activity rules judge.
- **Null-vs-zero discipline holds, and one CloudWatch option is refused because of it.** `Missing` (default), `NotBreaching` and `Ignore` all ship; `breaching` — absence counts as over the line — does not, because it would turn "the watch is off the wrist" into a three-in-the-morning page. Data absence keeps its own producer in `InactivityDetectionWorker`, which is the same separation Cloud Monitoring draws by making metric-absence its own policy type.
- **Provisional baselines still never alert.** Baseline-relative threshold kinds resolve against the established 30-day row only; without one the alarm reports insufficient data.
- Paused members are skipped, and a disabled alarm is not evaluated at all rather than evaluated and suppressed.
- Suggested defaults and the published guidance behind each number: [alarm_catalogue.md](../../technical/alarm_catalogue.md).

### QuestionnaireExpiryWorker

Retires the family questions that outlived the day they asked about (`MemberQuestionnaire.AskableUntilUtc`, see [questionnaires.md](../../execution/backend/api/questionnaires.md)).

- Runs **every 20 minutes**, offset from the quarter-hour jobs (`0 12-59/20 * * * *`).
- **Not what keeps a stale card off a caregiver's screen** — the listing endpoint already refuses to serve a lapsed question and the apps retire one on sight. What this is for is the member whose family has not opened the app: their question sits `Pending` against a day that ended, and a pending row blocks every future question for that member.
- Worker-hosted per CLAUDE.md: no AI call, and DB polling belongs here. The pipeline writes questions; this only ages them out, on a timestamp comparison with no model near it.
- Retires at most **500** rows a pass, oldest lapse first. Generously above the fleet's real rate (at most one question per member per week, and only the unanswered ones reach here) — the cap guards against one long outage's backlog arriving as a single unbounded write, not against ordinary days.

### DeviceSyncAuditWorker

Measures something `WearableSyncWorker` structurally cannot see. A routine sync only ever looks inside its own trailing window, so with `SyncLookbackDays: 3` a provider that amends day 5 is not merely unmeasured — it is *unmeasurable*, and any picture of "how far back data changes" built from routine syncs alone would be an artefact of our own schedule rather than a fact about the provider.

- Runs weekly, Sunday 04:00 UTC (`0 0 4 * * 0`), after the baseline and cleanup jobs.
- Re-fetches a **random sample** of `SampleSize` connections (default **25**) over `AuditLookbackDays` (default **14** — the widest range the Google Health API accepts for heart-rate, active-zone-minutes and calorie roll-ups). Randomised because any stable ordering would audit the same connections forever and characterise one corner of the population.
- Eligibility is identical to the routine query minus due-ness: `GetRandomSyncableSampleAsync` excludes removed and monitoring-paused members, because **an audit still collects a member's health data** and pausing has to stop every collection path, not just the scheduled one.
- Goes through `IDeviceSyncService.AuditSyncAsync`, which shares the pull-and-merge core with the routine sync but **stamps nothing**: no `LastSyncDate` (that would push the connection's next routine pull out by a full interval, so a job that only measures would quietly change what gets collected) and no `SyncError` transition (a historical day failing says nothing about whether the connection works now).
- It still stores and merges whatever it finds, so a provider's late correction to a member's history is **repaired as a side effect of measuring it**.
- Failures log at **Warning**, not Error: an audit failure costs measurement precision, not data.

### DeviceAuthRecoveryWorker

Retries the refresh token of device connections the provider has **refused**, so a connection that can come back does so on its own (`DeviceAuthRecoveryService`) rather than waiting for a caregiver to notice and reconnect.

- Runs **every 15 minutes**, offset from the other quarter-hour jobs (`0 3-59/15 * * * *`). Fifteen minutes is the *pass* cadence, not the retry cadence — each connection carries its own **widening backoff** (migration `AddDeviceAuthRecoveryBackoff`), so a pass mostly finds nothing due.
- Worker-hosted per CLAUDE.md: no AI call is involved, and DB polling belongs here.
- Logs at Information only when it actually returns connections to service.

### DataCompletenessWorker

Detects the gaps between what CardiTrack needs and what each account has supplied, and reconciles them against what the caregiver has already been told — the engine behind the in-app data-completeness nudges ([notification_engine.md](../../technical/notification_engine.md)).

- Runs **daily at 06:00 UTC** (`0 0 6 * * *`) — after `BaselineCalculationWorker`, so anything it says about learning progress reflects that morning's numbers rather than yesterday's.
- Takes a **non-blocking Postgres advisory lock** for the run: a second Cloud Run instance that cannot take it skips the run entirely instead of evaluating the whole estate again for one useful result. Reconciliation itself is idempotent by fingerprint, so a crashed run simply repeats.
- Walks organizations in batches of 50 (cursor-paged), one DI scope — and so one `DbContext` — per organization; one bad organization is logged and skipped, never costing the estate its morning run.
- Reconciliation is **per caregiver**: each user's stored notifications are diffed against their own contexts (`NudgeReconciler`), so one user's snooze cannot suppress another's notification.
- Every run writes a `NotificationRunLog` row (organizations scanned, created/resolved/suppressed counts, duration, error) — best-effort, a failed log write is a Warning, not a failed run.

### NotificationDispatchWorker

The push spine's pump ([notification_engine.md](../../technical/notification_engine.md) §6.2, §6.3, §13): claims due `NotificationDeliveries` outbox rows, retries them, runs the escalation ladder, and expires past-TTL rows.

- Runs **every 30 seconds** (`*/30 * * * * *`). Deliberately **no advisory lock** — unlike `DataCompletenessWorker` — because `NotificationDeliveryRepository.ClaimDueAsync`'s `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` claim (plus its claim-lease `NextAttemptAt` advance) already lets multiple instances divide the outbox in parallel safely.
- Each tick runs **four isolated phases**, each in its own scope, each catching its own failures: (1) claim + retry due rows (batches of 100, one scope per row); (2) the **escalation sweep** — Safety-category and Red health deliveries that stay unacknowledged are re-pushed, then fanned out to every other caregiver with `ReceiveAlerts`, then marked `UNDELIVERED_CRITICAL` with a `LogCritical`; (3) expiring past-TTL rows to `DeadLettered`; (4) disabling push tokens with **no liveness signal (ack or foreground heartbeat) in 7 days**.
- The phase isolation is load-bearing, not defensive decoration: a misconfigured `FirebaseApp` once made resolving `IDispatchService` throw on every sweep, and because this host doesn't override `BackgroundServiceExceptionBehavior`, every tick took the whole Worker down — 224 host restarts in two hours (incident 2026-08-12), during which **nothing else the Worker owns ran either**. A push outage should cost pushes, nothing more.

### PushCanaryWorker

Sends a real Safety-category push to a fleet of configured test devices every 15 minutes and checks whether the **previous** run's canary got acked ([notification_engine.md](../../technical/notification_engine.md) §13). Provider outages, expired credentials and a broken APNs certificate are otherwise silent failures — the kind discovered from a support ticket during an actual emergency.

- Runs **every 15 minutes** (`0 */15 * * * *`); the 15-minute ack window matches the escalation ladder's own SLO.
- Deliberately routed through the **normal outbox** (`IDispatchService.EnqueueAsync`) rather than a bespoke send path — the canary is only meaningful if it exercises the exact same planning, send, and ack code every real Safety alert goes through.
- The fleet is **configured, not auto-discovered** (`Workers:PushCanaryWorker:CanaryUserIds`); an empty list skips quietly rather than paging on a fleet nobody set up. A previous canary not `Delivered` by the next run logs at **Critical** and increments the `UndeliveredCritical` telemetry counter with a `canary` reason tag.

### Multi-Provider Dispatch

Providers register keyed services per **HealthApi engine** via extension methods (shared with the API in `CardiTrack.Infrastructure/Extensions/DeviceProviderServiceExtensions.cs`); which hardware brands ride an engine is configuration (the block's `DeviceTypes` list), not code:

```csharp
// Program.cs
builder.Services.AddGoogleHealthProvider();

// AddGoogleHealthProvider registers the Google Health API engine — HTTP client, keyed
// IDeviceApiClient (GoogleHealthApiClient) and keyed IDeviceSyncService, keyed by
// HealthApi.GoogleHealth — serving every DeviceType in the block's list
// (Fitbit AND GooglePixelWatch today).

// To add a new API later: create an equivalent AddGarminConnectProvider()
```

Unknown device types produce a `LogWarning` and are skipped — no crash. `AddGoogleHealthProvider` also enforces the positional-index contract: **`DeviceProviders[0]` must be the GoogleHealth provider** (deployment injects its secrets as `DeviceProviders__0__*`), and startup throws if the list is reordered, if a block's `DeviceTypes` is empty or names an unknown type, or if two blocks claim the same device type.

### Adding a new worker

`WorkerServiceExtensions.AddWorker<T>` is the generic registration pattern — one line per job:

```csharp
// WorkerServiceExtensions.cs
public static IServiceCollection AddWorker<T>(
    this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration, string name)
    where T : BackgroundService
{
    services.Configure<WorkerOptions>(name, configuration.GetSection($"Workers:{name}"));
    services.AddHostedService<T>();
    return services;
}

// Program.cs — one line per job, all 13:
builder.Services.AddWorker<WearableSyncWorker>(configuration, nameof(WearableSyncWorker));
builder.Services.AddWorker<OrphanedOrganizationCleanupWorker>(configuration, nameof(OrphanedOrganizationCleanupWorker));
builder.Services.AddWorker<OrphanedPhotoCleanupWorker>(configuration, nameof(OrphanedPhotoCleanupWorker));
builder.Services.AddWorker<BaselineCalculationWorker>(configuration, nameof(BaselineCalculationWorker));
builder.Services.AddWorker<DeviceSyncAuditWorker>(configuration, nameof(DeviceSyncAuditWorker));
builder.Services.AddWorker<PartitionMaintenanceWorker>(configuration, nameof(PartitionMaintenanceWorker));
builder.Services.AddWorker<InactivityDetectionWorker>(configuration, nameof(InactivityDetectionWorker));
builder.Services.AddWorker<StatisticalAlertWorker>(configuration, nameof(StatisticalAlertWorker));
builder.Services.AddWorker<QuestionnaireExpiryWorker>(configuration, nameof(QuestionnaireExpiryWorker));
builder.Services.AddWorker<DeviceAuthRecoveryWorker>(configuration, nameof(DeviceAuthRecoveryWorker));
builder.Services.AddWorker<DataCompletenessWorker>(configuration, nameof(DataCompletenessWorker));
builder.Services.AddWorker<NotificationDispatchWorker>(configuration, nameof(NotificationDispatchWorker));
builder.Services.AddWorker<PushCanaryWorker>(configuration, nameof(PushCanaryWorker));
```

To add a job: derive from `CronBackgroundService`, take `IOptionsMonitor<WorkerOptions>` in the constructor and pass `options.Get(nameof(YourWorker)).CronExpression` to the base, then call `AddWorker<YourWorker>(configuration, nameof(YourWorker))` and add a `Workers:YourWorker:CronExpression` entry to config. Without a config entry the `WorkerOptions` default (`"0 * * * * *"` — every minute) applies.

## Configuration

### appsettings.json

Cron schedules bind per worker class name under the `Workers` section, consumed through named `IOptionsMonitor<WorkerOptions>`:

}
```

`Encryption:Key` ships empty and must be supplied at runtime — a base64-encoded 256-bit key, matching the API's (both encrypt and decrypt the same stored OAuth tokens). `docker compose` sets it for you; running standalone, use `openssl rand -base64 32` into `Encryption__Key` or user secrets. The Worker validates the key while building the host and exits if it is missing or malformed, rather than failing every token-refresh run.

### Per-device-type pull parameters

Cadence belongs to the **device type**, not to any one connection: providers differ in how quickly they finalise a day and how hard they rate-limit. These are set per environment in `infrastructure/environments/*.tfvars` under `device_pull_params`, and reach the app as `DeviceProviders__<i>__*` env vars — the same positional binding already used for provider secrets, which is why element 0 must stay the GoogleHealth provider.

| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sync_lookback_days` | 3 | Trailing window each routine sync re-fetches |
| `audit_lookback_days` | 14 | Window `DeviceSyncAuditWorker` uses; must be ≥ `sync_lookback_days` |
| `min_pull_interval_minutes` | 30 (**both environments deploy 10**) | Floor on a connection's interval — derived from the provider's rate limit; dev and prod tfvars both set 10 to match the 10-minute sync cadence |
| `max_pull_interval_minutes` | 1440 | Ceiling, so dormancy backoff cannot park a connection indefinitely |
| `max_requests_per_second` | 0 | Provider-wide ceiling for sizing the pull queue; 0 leaves it unset |
| `dormancy_threshold_pulls` | 0 | Empty pulls in a row before backoff starts; **0 disables backoff** |
| `dormancy_backoff_factor` | 2.0 | Multiplier per empty pull past the threshold |

> **The bounds are the guard, and widening them is deliberately a deploy.** Cadence calibration may move a connection's interval anywhere within `[min, max]` but never outside it. A miscomputed cadence in a cardiac-monitoring product does not cost throughput — it silently delays alerts — so the range that constrains it lives in version-controlled infrastructure rather than in a table the calculator can rewrite.

Both `AddGoogleHealthProvider`'s `PostConfigure` and the Terraform variable validate the same rules (positive floor, floor ≤ ceiling, backoff factor > 1 when enabled, audit window ≥ sync window). Duplicated on purpose: the plan fails before a bad revision deploys, and the host fails fast if one is set some other way.

### Cron Format

The worker uses 6-field cron with seconds (Cronos `IncludeSeconds`):

| Expression            | Meaning                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| `0 */10 * * * *`      | Every 10 minutes          |
| `0 0 * * * *`         | Every hour                |
| `0 0 3 * * *`         | Daily at 3 AM UTC         |
| `0 0 2 * * MON`       | Every Monday at 2 AM UTC  |

### Production Secrets

Deployed configuration comes from env vars on the Cloud Run service; sensitive values are **GCP Secret Manager-backed** (`worker_secret_env_vars` in `infrastructure/main.tf`) — never in `appsettings.json`:

```
ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection = carditrack-<env>-db-connection-string
Auth0__Domain / __Audience / __ClientId / __ClientSecret = carditrack-<env>-auth0-*
Encryption__Key                      = carditrack-<env>-encryption-key
Health__Token                        = carditrack-<env>-health-token
DeviceProviders__0__ClientId         = carditrack-<env>-devices-fitbit-client-id
DeviceProviders__0__ClientSecret     = carditrack-<env>-devices-fitbit-client-secret
Apm__Data                            = carditrack-<env>-apm-data
```

Plaintext env vars: `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`, `GCP_PROJECT_ID`, `Apm__Engine`, `Apm__MetricsEnabled`, `Apm__TracesSampleRatio`, `Serilog__MinimumLevel__Default`, plus the per-device-type pull parameters below. The last two come from the per-service `traces_sample_ratio` / `log_minimum_level` tfvars (`worker` attribute) — traces `1.0` everywhere; the worker's log level is **`Warning` in prod and `Information` in dev** (dev sets it deliberately).

> **Consequence of the prod `Warning` baseline:** in prod the per-run `LogInformation` lines below (`triggered`, `complete. Success: n, Failed: n`) are **not emitted** — a healthy run leaves no trace, and only per-member failures (`LogWarning`/`LogError`) surface. Cron is internal to the service (`CronBackgroundService`), so there is no per-run request log to fall back on. **Dev already runs the worker at `Information`**, so the run summaries are emitted there; to get them in prod, set `log_minimum_level = { worker = "Information" }` in its tfvars.

> **Provider note:** the `GoogleHealth` provider block authenticates against **Google OAuth** and pulls data from the **Google Health API** (`health.googleapis.com`) for every device type it serves (Fitbit, Google Pixel Watch) — the legacy Fitbit Web API is decommissioned September 2026. Google access tokens are short-lived (~1 hour), hence `TokenLifetimeHours: 1`. `GoogleHealthApiClient` reads each data type by the method that type supports: `dataPoints:dailyRollUp` for the Interval and Sample metrics (including `sedentary-period`, whose `durationSum` is a protobuf `Duration` — seconds with a literal `s` suffix, `"28800s"` — converted to minutes), and `dataPoints` list for sleep sessions, for the Daily records `daily-resting-heart-rate`, `daily-vo2-max`, `daily-respiratory-rate` and `daily-sleep-temperature-derivations` (which have no rollup), and for the `oxygen-saturation` sample series. SpO2 is listed rather than rolled up because the rollup union carries no `oxygenSaturation` member at all: average, minimum and maximum are derived from the samples so all three describe one series, and the `daily-oxygen-saturation` summary is used only as a fallback for the average — its `lowerBoundPercentage`/`upperBoundPercentage` describe the day's distribution, not the lowest and highest readings, so they are never stored as min/max. Response field names, wire formats and enum members are checked against the v4 discovery document; whether each is actually populated for a given wearer's device is still pending live-sandbox verification. Note that a metric absent from a day's response is stored as **null, not 0** — an unworn or unsynced device is not a still one, and the merge and baseline both read a 0 as a real measurement.
>
> Some metrics are allowed to fail without failing the sync: a `400`/`404` on `daily-resting-heart-rate`, or on any of the optional metrics (`oxygen-saturation`, `daily-vo2-max`, `daily-respiratory-rate`, `daily-sleep-temperature-derivations`), leaves that column null, since not every device derives them — most Fitbits derive none of the optional four. The exception is a **malformed-request** `400` — one carrying `google.rpc.BadRequest` field violations, which only ever means the request we built is wrong. Those propagate and mark the connection `SyncError`, because resting HR anchors the HR baseline and a silent null there degrades alerting instead of reporting a fault. That guard is what surfaced the `resting-heart-rate` data-type bug, and then the camelCase `filter` member path (`dailyRestingHeartRate.date`, where the grammar wants the snake_case data type `daily_resting_heart_rate.date`), rather than letting either degrade the baseline unnoticed.

## Running Locally

```bash
# Navigate to worker project
cd src/Worker/CardiTrack.Worker

# Restore and run
dotnet run
```

The worker starts an HTTP listener (default port 8080, or `PORT` if set) for `/healthz`. Run logging is `Information`, which the local appsettings `Warning` baseline suppresses — set `Serilog__MinimumLevel__Default=Information` (and `Logging__LogLevel__Default=Information`, already the appsettings value) to see each run, as deployed dev already does (prod stays at `Warning` and suppresses these):
```
[06:00:00 INF] WearableSync triggered at 2026-03-12T06:00:00.000Z
[06:00:04 INF] WearableSync complete. Success: 12, Failed: 0.
```

## Deployment

### Docker

The real `Dockerfile` is multi-stage (SDK build → publish → chiseled runtime). Key points of the runtime stage — note the **aspnet** base (not `runtime`; Cloud Run needs the HTTP listener) and the cleared `ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS`:

```dockerfile
# Runtime — chiseled Ubuntu: minimal, non-root (UID 1654), no shell.
# aspnet (not runtime) because Cloud Run health probes need /healthz over HTTP.
# "-extra" adds ICU and tzdata, needed for the Worker's time-zone-aware jobs.
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:10.0-noble-chiseled-extra AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --chown=1654:1654 --from=publish /app/publish .
EXPOSE 8080

# Clear the base image's ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS so the app's UseUrls
# (bound to Cloud Run's PORT env var) is the sole binding source
ENV ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=
ENV ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "CardiTrack.Worker.dll"]
```

```bash
docker build -f src/Worker/CardiTrack.Worker/Dockerfile -t carditrack-worker .
docker run -e ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="..." -e PORT=8080 carditrack-worker
```

### Cloud Run

The worker deploys as the Cloud Run service `carditrack-<env>-worker` (Terraform module `deployments`, config in `infrastructure/main.tf`). Cloud Run supplies `PORT`; the startup probe hits `/healthz`.

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

The worker rides the shared app pipelines — there is no worker-specific workflow file:

- `.github/workflows/deploy-apps-dev.yml` — on changes under `src/Worker/**` (or shared projects): `build-worker` → `test-unit-worker` → `security-worker` → `push-worker-image` → `deploy-worker-dev` (`gcloud run deploy carditrack-dev-worker`).
- `.github/workflows/deploy-apps-prod.yml` — the promotion path to `carditrack-prod-worker`.

## Monitoring

Logging mirrors the API: **Serilog console sink** always, plus `AddApmShipping` (logs) and `AddApmTracing` (OTel traces) from `CardiTrack.Observability` when `Apm__Engine` + `Apm__Data` are configured. `/healthz` probe traffic is excluded from tracing. Both signals carry the release version — the `Version` log property and OTel's `service.version`, from `DeploymentInfo`. See the [API readme's APM section](../api/readme.md#apm-shipping-carditrackobservability) for the shared config contract and [release version on telemetry](../api/readme.md#release-version-on-telemetry-deploymentinfo) for how the version is stamped.
